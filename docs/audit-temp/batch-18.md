### Batch 18 (2026-02-21) - 5 Lessons

| Lesson | Queue | Verdict | Issues Found | Fixed |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Climbing and Balancing Activities | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No vocabulary section, no muscle names, no anatomy, no physiology. Warm-up cues said "wake up our legs" without naming quadriceps, glutes, or tibialis anterior. Coaching cues were purely procedural (e.g., "use your arms like wings") with no biomechanical explanation. No mention of center of gravity, vestibular system, proprioception, or Newton's Third Law. Cool-down mentioned breathing but not the diaphragm or parasympathetic nervous system. Vestibular system appeared once in challenges section but was not taught to children. | Added full vocabulary section naming quadriceps, gluteus maximus, core muscles, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior; defined center of gravity, vestibular system (semicircular canals), proprioception, Newton's Third Law, and bilateral coordination with explanations. Rewrote warm-up cues to name specific muscles being activated. Rewrote coaching cues to include anatomical and biomechanical language (center of gravity, vestibular system, neural pathways). Rewrote cool-down to name hamstrings, gastrocnemius, diaphragm, and parasympathetic nervous system. Expanded the vestibular/balance "Why" explanation to name transverse abdominis, erector spinae, peroneals, tibialis posterior, and myelination. |
| Volleyball and Net Sports | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No vocabulary section, no muscle names, no anatomy, no physiology. Warm-up mentioned "windmill arms" without naming deltoids or rotator cuff. Coaching cues mentioned "pendulum" swing without explaining momentum transfer. No explanation of visual tracking (smooth pursuit), hand-eye coordination neural circuit, reaction time, projectile motion/parabola, or cardiovascular response. Cool-down mentioned breathing with no physiology. | Added full vocabulary section naming deltoids (anterior/lateral/posterior), triceps brachii, pectoralis major, serratus anterior, and core stabilizers; defined visual tracking (smooth pursuit), hand-eye coordination (visual cortex to motor cortex feedback loop), reaction time (150-200ms, myelin development), projectile motion (parabola, gravity), momentum transfer, and cardiovascular response. Rewrote warm-up cues to name deltoids, latissimus dorsi, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and Achilles tendon. Rewrote coaching cues to include center of gravity, motor cortex, parabola, and neural pathway language. Rewrote cool-down to name heart rate physiology, specific muscles being stretched, diaphragm, and parasympathetic nervous system. |
| Soccer and Football | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No vocabulary section, no muscle names, no anatomy, no physiology. Warm-up mentioned "leg swings" and "knee lifts" without naming hip flexors or quadriceps. Coaching cues were purely procedural ("use the inside of your foot," "stand on one strong leg") with no biomechanical explanation. No mention of the kicking lever, center of percussion, foot dominance/laterality, proprioception, or momentum. Cool-down mentioned breathing and stretching with no physiology. | Added full vocabulary section naming quadriceps (four individual muscles), iliopsoas (hip flexors), gluteus medius (single-leg balance stabilizer), gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior; defined the kicking lever (fulcrum at hip, force from quads/hip flexors, foot as lever end), center of percussion (instep vs inside of foot), foot dominance and laterality (brain hemisphere), proprioception (feel without looking), and momentum/force transfer. Rewrote warm-up cues to name iliopsoas, tibialis anterior, hip abductors, and Achilles tendon. Rewrote coaching cues to include gluteus medius, proprioception, momentum, and neural pathway language. Rewrote cool-down to name hamstrings, gastrocnemius, iliopsoas, quadriceps, diaphragm, and parasympathetic nervous system. |
| Food Styling and Presentation | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary section used only vague aesthetic/everyday words: "presentation," "palette," "aesthetic," "arrangement" — none with real scientific or technical content. Activities were pure themed play ("food artists!") with no food science: no mention of pigments, phytonutrients, color chemistry, oxidation, or design principles grounded in actual science. "Eat the rainbow" mentioned in extensions with no explanation of why. Texture sorting had no explanation of what makes food crunchy or soft at the cellular level. | Replaced entire vocabulary section with real technical terms and explanations: pigment (light absorption/reflection), anthocyanins (blue/red/purple pigments, antioxidants), carotenoids (orange/yellow pigments, beta-carotene → vitamin A), chlorophyll (green pigment, photosynthesis), phytonutrients (protective plant compounds, why "eat the rainbow" is real science), contrast and complementary colors (color wheel, professional design), oxidation (browning chemical reaction, citric acid inhibition), and texture (plant cell wall structure). Rewrote activity introduction to teach pigment groups by color. Rewrote exploration step to sort foods by pigment group and explain complementary contrast. Rewrote guided discovery to name color wheel pairs and explain phytonutrients. Rewrote wrap-up to reinforce pigment vocabulary. Updated age adaptations to include vocabulary teaching goals for 2-3 year olds. Replaced all 5 extension variations with science-grounded activities: pigment group sorting, oxidation experiment (apple + lemon juice), complementary contrast design, texture science with cell wall explanation, and Maillard reaction introduction. |
| Science Experiments and Discovery | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Most egregious failure: a lesson titled "Science Experiments and Discovery" containing zero science content. Vocabulary contained only process words (observe, experiment, discover, transform) — the feeling of science with no actual subject matter. No explanation of diffusion (why food coloring spreads in water), acid-base reactions (what actually produces the fizz: CO2 from acetic acid + sodium bicarbonate), polarity (why oil and water don't mix: polar vs nonpolar molecules), or subtractive color mixing (why pigment combinations produce specific colors). Activities were structured play with science props. Scientific method mentioned in wrap-up only as praise, not actually taught. | Replaced entire vocabulary section with real scientific vocabulary: diffusion (molecule movement from high to low concentration), molecule (defined with H₂O example), chemical reaction (defined with acid-base CO2 production example), acid and base (with neutralization), polarity (polar water vs nonpolar oil, why they don't mix), subtractive color mixing (pigment light absorption, why yellow+blue=green), hypothesis (prediction before experiment), and scientific method (full 5-step process). Rewrote all activity steps to follow the scientific method explicitly and teach the mechanism behind each phenomenon. Rewrote Experiment 1 to explain diffusion and subtractive color mixing. Added full Experiment 2 rewrite to explain acid-base chemistry (CO2 production, neutralization). Added full Experiment 3 rewrite to explain polarity and why oil/water separate. Rewrote age adaptations to include vocabulary goals for 2-3 year olds and variable-testing for 3-4+ year olds. Replaced extension variations with real science experiments: temperature vs diffusion rate (controlled variable), density column (density layers with sugar water), and chromatography (pigment separation with marker + coffee filter). Rewrote follow-up activities to include real science content. |
