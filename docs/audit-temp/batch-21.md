### Batch 21 (2026-02-21) - 5 Lessons

| Lesson | Queue | Verdict | Issues Found | Fixed |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Survival Skills and Wilderness Play | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No vocabulary section at all. No muscle names, anatomy, or physiology anywhere. Coaching cues were purely behavioral ("step carefully," "look closely") with zero anatomical or biomechanical content. Survival/nature content used no real scientific terms — no ecology vocabulary (ecosystem, decomposer, habitat, photosynthesis), no named muscles, no physiology of balance. | Added full Vocabulary section with: proprioception, stabilizer muscles (tibialis anterior, peroneals), gluteus medius, vestibular system (semicircular canals), thermoregulation, cortisol/adrenaline, ecosystem, decomposer, habitat, camouflage, photosynthesis, foraging, tracking. Rewrote coaching cues to name ankle stabilizer muscles, vestibular system, and ecological facts (decomposers in logs, bark anatomy, moss as a compass). Rewrote skill breakdown to explain the biomechanics of uneven-ground walking and real ecology in observation/shelter/navigation. Enriched proprioception explanation in Common Challenges with myelination note. |
| Color Guard and Flag Work | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No vocabulary section. No muscle names in coaching cues or warm-up. Warm-up named only "arm and shoulder muscles" vaguely. Coaching cues were entirely behavioral ("hold lightly like a bird," "let the flag flow"). No physics or art terms. No biomechanics of the circular and pendulum movements. | Added full Vocabulary section with: deltoid (three heads), rotator cuff (four named muscles), wrist extensors and flexors, bilateral coordination, proprioception, muscle memory/motor learning, core stabilizers (transversus abdominis, multifidus). Also added physics terms: momentum, angular momentum, centripetal force, choreography. Rewrote warm-up cue to name deltoids. Rewrote coaching cues to explain forearm muscles controlling the flag tip, momentum, centripetal force, and core stabilization. Fixed Common Challenges entry to name forearm flexors/extensors and reference motor learning. |
| Sculpture and 3D Art with Clay/Playdough | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary section had only 4 generic terms (sculpture, texture, mold, spatial awareness) — no materials science, no art history, no real technical terms. Activities were purely process-based with no actual conceptual content. Anti-rigor instruction in 2-3 years adaptation explicitly said "Use short tool names like 'snake,' 'ball,' 'squish,' and 'pull'" — actively discouraging real vocabulary. No mention of additive vs. subtractive sculpture, plasticity, armature, kiln, polymers, or any historical context. | Replaced vocabulary section with 10 rigorous terms: sculpture (with 40,000-year history, Lion-Man figurine), plasticity (kaolinite/illite/montmorillonite mineral platelets), additive sculpture, subtractive sculpture (Michelangelo reference), relief sculpture, armature, texture, kiln (vitrification at 900-1,400°C), polymer (wheat starch polymers in playdough), volume and form. Fixed anti-rigor age adaptation to instruct caregivers to use real vocabulary while narrating. Rewrote Introduction step to explain plasticity and 3D vs 2D. Rewrote Guided Creation step to name coil-building, pinch pot (ancient technique), additive and subtractive methods in context. |
| Media Creation and Sharing | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary had only 4 basic everyday terms (creator, audience, media, share) — no technical content. No mention of pixels, image sensors, lenses, file formats, compression, digital vs. analog, microphones, sound waves, digital sampling, networking, or fiber optics. The entire activity was process-based (take a photo, share it) with no explanation of how any of the technology works at even a basic level. The wrap-up step had no content about what happens when you press "send." | Replaced vocabulary with 10 technical terms: creator/author, media (etymology), audience, pixel (RGB values 0-255), lens (refraction, aperture), image sensor (photodiodes, electrical signals), resolution (megapixels, 1080p definition), file format/compression (JPEG algorithm, PNG, MP4 codecs), microphone (sound waves → electrical → binary), transmission/network (Wi-Fi, fiber optics, speed of light). Added digital vs. analog definition. Rewrote Introduction to explain how the lens and image sensor work before taking a photo. Rewrote Wrap-up to narrate the full transmission path (digital file → radio waves → cell tower → fiber optics → recipient's device) as the child sends the image. |
| Video Games and Digital Play | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary had only 4 terms (interface, navigate, interact, respond) — all purely behavioral with no technical content. No mention of how touchscreens work, what a processor is, what pixels are, how sound is generated, what code/algorithms are, or what a frame rate is. Discovery step mentioned cause-and-effect at the behavioral level only ("when you tapped, it made a sound") with no mechanism explained. Age adaptations further simplified without any technical enrichment. | Replaced vocabulary with 11 technical terms: interface, touchscreen/capacitive sensing (electrical charge grid, finger conductivity, coordinate detection), pixel (RGB LEDs, 16 million colors), processor/CPU (millions of instructions/second, 30-60fps), algorithm (if-then step-by-step instructions, concrete game example), code/programming (Python/C++/JavaScript), input and output (as computing concepts), digital sound synthesis (DAC, frequency, amplitude), frame rate (30fps, persistence of vision), navigate (as data loading), game engine (Unity/Unreal, physics, collision). Rewrote Introduction to explain touchscreen capacitive sensing and processor before first tap, and to frame tapping as "input" and game response as "output." Rewrote Discovery step to explain coordinate detection, algorithm execution, and pixel visibility. Enriched 2-3 years adaptation to use input/output terminology and suggest pointing out visible pixels. |
