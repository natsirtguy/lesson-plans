### Batch 22 (2026-02-21) - 5 Lessons

| Lesson | Queue | Verdict | Issues Found | Fixed |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Snowshoeing and Winter Hiking | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No vocabulary section; no anatomy or physiology; no muscle names anywhere (not in coaching cues, warm-up, or cool-down); no physics of snowshoes (flotation, pressure distribution, surface area); no explanation of thermoregulation, UV reflection, or wind chill despite all three being directly relevant; coaching cues were purely motivational metaphors with zero technical content | Added full Key Vocabulary section covering flotation/pressure/traction (snowshoe physics), quadriceps/hip flexors/tibialis anterior/core muscles (named muscles with roles), vestibular system/proprioception (balance science), and thermoregulation/UV radiation/wind chill (winter environment science); rewrote warm-up cues to explain which muscles are activating and why; added muscle names to all coaching cues; enriched introduction to explain snowshoe flotation physics with crampons named; added physics of snow types (air trapped between ice crystals); updated cool-down to name muscles worked and explain thermoregulation |
| Aikido and Redirecting Force | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No vocabulary section; the summary promised physics concepts (momentum, direction, balance) but none were taught; no anatomy — no muscles named despite leg pivoting, core stabilization, and hip rotation being central; coaching cues were 100% nature metaphors ("move like water," "root of a tree") with zero physics or anatomy; center of gravity mentioned but never explained; the lesson is explicitly about redirecting force but never defines force, momentum, or vector | Added full Key Vocabulary section covering force/momentum/vector/center of mass/base of support (physics), proprioception/vestibular system/core muscles/hip external rotators/gluteus medius (anatomy), and aiki/irimi/tenkan (authentic aikido terminology); rewrote introduction to explain the physics of redirection (tap-sideways analogy), base of support, and center of mass; replaced all metaphor-only coaching cues with anatomical and physics references; rewrote game description to use "vector change" and "momentum" correctly; updated cool-down to introduce parasympathetic nervous system |
| Badminton and Shuttlecock Games | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No vocabulary section; the shuttlecock's unique aerodynamic properties (drag, self-righting) — the most distinctive thing about badminton — were never mentioned; no muscle names (deltoid, rotator cuff, wrist extensors/flexors never named); no visual neuroscience despite "tracking" being a stated focus; "Gravity Game" named but gravity never explained; coaching cues were entirely motivational ("you're doing great!") or metaphorical with zero technical content; the lesson missed the physics that makes badminton unique among all racket sports | Added full Key Vocabulary section covering shuttlecock/aerodynamic drag/self-righting/trajectory (shuttlecock physics), rotator cuff/deltoid/wrist extensors and flexors/biceps/serratus anterior (named muscles with roles), visual tracking/binocular depth perception/hand-eye coordination (vision neuroscience), and impulse/gravity (hitting physics); rewrote warm-up cues to name rotator cuff, deltoid, and wrist mechanics; enriched introduction to explain the shuttlecock's unique aerodynamic properties and self-righting physics; replaced coaching cues with anatomical and physics references; updated Gravity Game to explain drag vs. gravity; updated cool-down to name muscles worked and explain neural pathway strengthening |
| Senses and Perception | Knowledge | PASS | N/A | N/A — Lesson already demonstrates genuine intellectual rigor: strong vocabulary section with photoreceptors (rod/cone counts and spectral types), cochlea anatomy (malleus/incus/stapes, 3,500 hair cells, frequency mapping), olfactory receptors (400 types, 1 trillion smells, limbic system direct pathway); activity integrates Meissner's vs Pacinian corpuscles, 2,500 mechanoreceptors/cm² in fingertips, umami as 5th taste, nose-pinch taste test; age adaptations include two-point discrimination test, sensory adaptation/habituation, synesthesia, and dedicated brain regions |
| Pattern Recognition and Creation | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary used only everyday words (repetition, rhythm, sequence, predict) with no mathematical content; no mathematical terms: periodicity, motif, AB/AAB/ABC pattern notation, symmetry types (reflective/rotational/translational), tessellation, Fibonacci sequence, fractals, algorithm — all directly relevant and fully accessible to young children through physical examples; activity described pattern-making as process with zero mathematical structure; "Nature Pattern Hunt" extension missed the specific Fibonacci spirals and fractal branching that actually appear in nature; the lesson taught the feeling of recognizing patterns without any content about what patterns mathematically are | Rewrote entire vocabulary section with 8 real mathematical terms: pattern (mathematical definition), periodicity (with period length), motif/repeating unit, symmetry (all three types defined), Fibonacci sequence (with the actual rule and natural examples), fractal (with concrete examples), algorithm, and prediction (as mathematical function concept); rewrote activity flow to name pattern types using AB/AAB notation, explain motif identification as key skill, introduce all three symmetry types with physical demonstrations, explain Fibonacci spirals in sunflowers/pinecones, and explain fractals in ferns/trees; updated age adaptations to include formal notation, Fibonacci counting, fractal observation, and algorithm concept; enriched Nature Pattern Hunt to target Fibonacci spirals and fractal structure specifically |
