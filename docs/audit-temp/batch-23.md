### Batch 23 (2026-02-21) - 5 Lessons

| Lesson | Queue | Verdict | Issues Found | Fixed |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Coordination and Agility Training | Physical | PASS | Already had strong vocabulary section (motor cortex, cerebellum, center of gravity, vestibular system) and coaching cues with real anatomy (quadriceps, deltoids, muscle spindles, semicircular canals). Activities grounded in neuroscience. | N/A |
| Critical Thinking Puzzles | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary used only everyday words: "solve," "puzzle," "pattern," "persist" — no cognitive science terms at all. No mention of executive function, prefrontal cortex, working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, or divergent vs. convergent thinking. Activities were pure puzzle play with no intellectual content backing them. Placeholder comment ("Select 3-4 vocabulary words...") was not removed. | Rewrote vocabulary section with: executive function (working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility), prefrontal cortex (mid-20s maturation), hypothesis (testable prediction, scientific process), spatial reasoning (parietal lobe), pattern recognition (visual cortex + prefrontal cortex), trial and error (empirical testing). Updated activity coaching cues to narrate the cognitive process: naming hypotheses, data from failed tests, working memory, inhibitory control, pattern recognition. Updated age adaptations to name metacognition explicitly for 3-4+ years. |
| Fine and Gross Motor Skills | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary used only everyday words: "coordinate," "balance," "strength," "control" — no anatomy, neuroscience, or physiology. Placeholder comment ("Select 3-4 vocabulary words...") still present in file. Activity descriptions were generic movement play with no scientific content. Muscle names absent throughout. | Rewrote vocabulary section with: motor cortex (homunculus map, voluntary movement signals at 120m/s), cerebellum (50% of brain neurons, error-correction), myelination (100x signal speed increase, gross motor before fine motor), proprioception (muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, cerebellum), fine motor vs. gross motor (specific muscle names: quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteus maximus, deltoids for gross; lumbricals, interossei, thenar muscles for fine), neuromuscular junction (acetylcholine, motor unit precision). Updated all activity stations to include muscle names, physiological explanations, and references to cerebellum/motor cortex. Updated 2-3 years adaptation to retain real vocabulary instead of recommending "simpler language." |
| Ice Hockey and Puck Sports | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No vocabulary section at all. Coaching cues were pure cheerleading ("like a goose on the ice!") with zero scientific content. No muscle names, no anatomy, no biomechanics, no physiology anywhere in the lesson. Cool-down had no explanation of why cool-down matters physiologically. | Added full vocabulary section with: proprioception on ice (vestibular system recalibration, cerebellum), center of gravity and ice (quadriceps, hip flexors, blade stability), glide and friction (gluteus maximus, quadriceps, hip abductors, iliotibial band for stops), core stability and skating (transversus abdominis, multifidus, obliques), stick handling and bilateral coordination (corpus callosum, wrist flexors/extensors, forearm pronation/supination), reaction time and skating (150-300ms, myelination). Rewrote coaching cues to include: quadriceps/core muscle names, transversus abdominis and obliques for stability, bilateral coordination naming, gluteus maximus/gastrocnemius for stride. Updated cool-down to explain lactate clearance, hamstring/iliopsoas stretching with muscle names, parasympathetic nervous system activation. |
| Understanding Others' Feelings (Empathy) | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary used only everyday words: "empathy," "compassion," "recognize," "comfort" — no neuroscience at all. Placeholder comment ("Select 3-4 vocabulary words that are sophisticated but age-appropriate...") still present in file. Activities were good structurally but had no neuroscience content explaining the mechanisms of empathy. | Rewrote vocabulary section with: mirror neurons (premotor cortex, discovered in macaques, basis of empathy and emotional contagion), theory of mind (false belief task, ages 2-5, prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction), oxytocin (hypothalamus, pituitary gland, amygdala calming, bonding hormone released during hugs), amygdala (emotional significance processing, sub-100ms response to facial expressions), emotional contagion (mirror neuron system, facial feedback loops, precursor to full empathy), facial action coding system (Paul Ekman, specific muscle names: zygomaticus major, orbicularis oculi, corrugator supercilii, depressor anguli oris). Updated activity to name specific facial muscles during emotion recognition, explain facial feedback loop when children copy expressions, explain oxytocin release during comforting, frame theory of mind explicitly. Updated age adaptations to retain real vocabulary for 2-3 years (mirror neurons, oxytocin) and explicitly introduce theory of mind as a concept for 3-4+ years. |
