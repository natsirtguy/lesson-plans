# Lesson Plan Intellectual Rigor Audit

Tracking file for auditing lesson plans against the educational philosophy of intellectual rigor (see CLAUDE.md). The goal is to ensure lessons use real terminology, include actual content rather than themed play, and trust children with genuine complexity.

## Audit Criteria

Each lesson is evaluated for:
1. **Real vocabulary** - Does the lesson use actual scientific/technical terms, or only everyday words?
2. **Substantive content** - Does the lesson teach real concepts, or is it just themed play with no intellectual payload?
3. **Complexity as backdrop** - Are activities enriched by real knowledge, or are they generic activities with a topic label?
4. **Trust in partial understanding** - Does the lesson introduce concepts that go beyond what a toddler will fully grasp, trusting that exposure has value?

## Audit Results

### Batch 1 (2026-02-09) - 10 Random Lessons

| Lesson | Queue | Verdict | Issues Found | Fixed |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Body Awareness and Coordination | Knowledge | PASS | Uses "proprioception," "gross motor skills," "neural pathways." Genuinely educational. | N/A |
| Jumping, Hopping, and Movement Games | Physical | PASS | Uses "bilateral coordination," "explosive power." Appropriate technical depth for physical lesson. | N/A |
| Hunting Simulation Games | Physical | PASS | Good connection to animal behavior and observation skills. Appropriate for genre. | N/A |
| Technology Experimentation | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary was everyday words ("technology," "device," "explore"). No explanation of how anything works — pure button-pressing. Suggested "technical language" for 3-4+ was "battery" and "button." | Replaced vocabulary with circuit, input/output, sensor, processor. Added real explanations of how electricity flows through circuits when buttons close them. Updated activity prompts and age adaptations with real technical content. |
| Card Games and Simple Gambling Games | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Said "That's luck!" about dice rolls with zero explanation of probability. No mathematical content despite being a math-adjacent topic. | Added probability to vocabulary with proper explanation (1-in-6 chance per die face). Updated activity dialogue to explain probability, randomness, and how memory changes your odds. Added distinction between games of skill vs. games of chance. |
| Finding Your Way Around | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Just walking through a living room obstacle course. No real navigation, cartography, or geography content. Vocabulary was everyday words only. | Added cardinal directions and map/cartography to vocabulary. Added content about the sun rising in the East, Earth as a giant magnet (compass), maps as bird's-eye representations, and scale. Updated age adaptations and follow-up activities. |
| Fix-it Activities and Repair Play | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Mentioned "mechanism" but never explained how any mechanism works. Activities were about the motion of unscrewing, not understanding what's inside. | Added real mechanical explanations: screws as inclined planes (threads), springs as energy storage, gears as motion transfer. Added "diagnose" to vocabulary. Updated activity flow to include real explanations during exploration. Added mechanical advantage concept to 3-4+ adaptations. |
| Study and Homework Play | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Entirely process-focused with no intellectual content. Vocabulary was motivational words (practice, persistence, focus, effort) with no substance. The lesson taught children to playact studying without studying anything real. | Replaced vocabulary with deliberate practice, working memory, metacognition, and persistence (with neuroscience backing). Updated activity flow with real content examples (vowels vs. consonants, mathematical sequences, Latin roots in shape names). Added metacognition prompts and protege effect. |
| Food Chains and Relationships | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Had good basic vocabulary (herbivore, carnivore, predator, prey) but missing major concepts. No energy transfer, no decomposers, no producer/consumer framework. | Added producer, decomposer, and energy transfer to vocabulary with full explanations (10% energy rule). Updated discovery section with decomposer cycle and energy pyramid concept. Enhanced 3-4+ adaptations with food webs, phytoplankton, and full vocabulary list. |
| Game Creation and Rule-Making | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Reasonable social/creative focus but missed opportunities to connect to formal concepts. Rules were treated as informal, not as logical structures. | Added conditional logic framing (if-then rules) and fairness/game theory to vocabulary. Updated rule-making phase to explicitly teach if-then structure and rule conflicts. Connected to computer programming and law as parallel systems. Added game theory framing to social negotiation. |
