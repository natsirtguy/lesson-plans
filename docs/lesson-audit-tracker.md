# Lesson Plan Intellectual Rigor Audit

Tracking file for auditing lesson plans against the educational philosophy of intellectual rigor (see CLAUDE.md). The goal is to ensure lessons use real terminology, include actual content rather than themed play, and trust children with genuine complexity.

## Audit Criteria

Each lesson is evaluated for:
1. **Real vocabulary** - Does the lesson use actual scientific/technical terms, or only everyday words?
2. **Substantive content** - Does the lesson teach real concepts, or is it just themed play with no intellectual payload?
3. **Complexity as backdrop** - Are activities enriched by real knowledge, or are they generic activities with a topic label?
4. **Trust in partial understanding** - Does the lesson introduce concepts that go beyond what a toddler will fully grasp, trusting that exposure has value?

Age adaptation for 2-3 explicitly said "Avoid complex vocabulary; use simple words" — directly contradicting the philosophy. No mention of time units (seconds, minutes, hours) despite these being the actual content. No explanation of how clocks physically measure time (oscillation, pendulums, atomic clocks). Sand timer was the only real content. | Removed template instruction text from vocabulary header. Replaced age adaptation to say real terms should be used with simple explanations alongside them. Added "oscillation" to vocabulary with pendulum clock explanation. Rewrote introduction to include history of timekeeping (sand timers → water clocks → sundials → atomic clocks), framed as humans inventing ways to measure time.

Replaced vocabulary with logic (rule-following reasoning, computers run on logic), deductive reasoning (general rule → specific conclusion, always true), inductive reasoning (observations → general rule, can be wrong), hypothesis (testable prediction, how science works), pattern (with mathematical examples: doubling sequence, Fibonacci in nature). Rewrote introduction to frame puzzles as logic — the tool used by detectives, scientists, and lawyers. Rewrote discovery section to name logical processes as they happen (deductive reasoning during edge-piece sorting, hypothesis testing during placement). Updated 2-3 age adaptation to use real vocabulary with simple explanations. Extended Variation 4 to include formal deductive games (process-of-elimination 20-questions style). |

Activity taught "finding things" without the intellectual structure of information gathering. | Replaced vocabulary with hypothesis (testable guess, scientific method), observation (direct sensory facts), inference (conclusion from evidence), evidence (multiple clues build case), systematic (organized search strategy, scientific experiment design). Rewrote introduction to frame searching with hypothesis → test → evidence framework. Updated discovery section to distinguish observation from inference and name the detective process explicitly. |
| Repetition and Practice | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary was all motivational/process words (repetition, persistence, progression, mastery). Zero neuroscience. No explanation of WHY practice works — no neuroplasticity, no myelination, no procedural memory, no deliberate practice research. Activity taught "doing things again" without the biology of skill acquisition. | Replaced vocabulary with neuroplasticity (physical brain changes, synaptic strengthening), myelination (myelin sheath, 100x signal speed, automatic feeling), synapse (Hebb's rule — "neurons that fire together, wire together"), procedural memory (basal ganglia/cerebellum storage, automatic skill), deliberate practice (Ericsson's research, focused attention matters). Rewrote introduction to explain neuroplasticity and myelination as the actual biology behind why practice works. |
| Paddleboarding and Balance on Water | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | Summary mentioned "balance proprioception" but didn't explain mechanisms. No physics of why board floats (buoyancy, Archimedes), no propulsion physics (Newton's Third Law), no explanation of why water balance is harder than land balance (unstable surface, vestibular challenge). Coaching cues were purely procedural. | Rewrote summary to explain buoyancy (Archimedes' principle, displaced water force), Newton's Third Law (push water back → board moves forward), vestibular system on unstable surface (constant semicircular canal updates), and cerebellar coordination. Updated coaching cues to reference center of gravity, Newton's Third Law, vestibular system, and paddle as balance tripod. |
| Art Installation and Display | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | "Installation" defined as "a painting on a wall, blocks in a tower, or drawings on string" — too broad and missing what installation art actually is as a movement. Vocabulary was all basic descriptors (installation, display, arrange, composition). No art history, no real installation artists, no design principles (contrast, visual weight, focal point, balance). | Replaced vocabulary with installation art (1960s-70s movement, Kusama's Infinity Rooms, Christo's The Gates, Turrell's light rooms — art that surrounds the viewer), composition (with contrast, balance, focal point, rhythm as real design principles), visual weight (how elements attract the eye), site-specific (art designed for a particular location). Rewrote introduction to explain installation art history and real artists. Updated wrap-up to teach focal point, balance, and visual weight as children view their finished work. |

|--------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Teaching and Demonstration (Physical Skills, Creative Techniques, Social Behaviors, Learning Concepts) | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary was generic (demonstrate, model, technique, instruct). No cognitive science of teaching — no protégé effect, no metacognition, no explanation of WHY teaching strengthens learning. Activity was pure role-play as "teacher" with zero intellectual content about how learning works. | Replaced vocabulary with protégé effect (scientific observation that teaching makes you learn better), metacognition (thinking about your own thinking), scaffold (support that can be gradually removed), and technique (refined definition). Rewrote summary with learning science. Updated introduction to name the protégé effect explicitly. Rewrote activity flow to name metacognition during explanation and scaffolding during the learning phase. Updated age adaptations to use all new vocabulary in context. |
| Camping and Outdoor Living Play | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No physics of shelter construction (what makes a roof shed rain, natural anchor points). No nature literacy — "animal watching" was "shhh, be very quiet" with no content about tracks, calls, or animal evidence. No Leave No Trace principles beyond "be safe." Coaching cues were positional with no science. | Rewrote summary with real outdoor skills context. Updated shelter-building section to explain sloped-roof rain-shedding, natural branch anchor points (V-shaped forks), and Leave No Trace (take only fallen materials).

Missing the actual cognitive skills involved: perspective-taking (theory of mind), oral narrative, audience awareness, descriptive precision. Vocabulary was generic (present, audience, confidence, special). | Replaced vocabulary with perspective-taking, theory of mind (other people have different knowledge), oral narrative (structured enough for unfamiliar listeners), descriptive language, audience awareness. Rewrote summary with developmental psychology context (theory of mind as a developmental milestone, connection to narrative comprehension and writing). Rewrote activity overview to frame the challenge as perspective-taking. Updated presentation step to push for precise descriptive language and name the cognitive skill when children use it. Updated 3-4+ adaptations with blind description game and perspective-taking debrief. |
| Deep Reading | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Good structure overall, but missing key concepts: inference (never named despite activities requiring it), visual narrative (illustrations as independent story layer), and the scientific terms inference and subtext. Vocabulary was decent but non-specific (attentive, illustrate, curious, pattern). | Rewrote summary to frame deep reading around inference, visual narrative, and two simultaneous stories (words vs. illustrations). Replaced vocabulary with inference (reading between the lines, the core deep reading skill), visual narrative (illustrator's separate story), subtext (unstated meaning), pattern (more specific definition). Updated first reading section to prompt both text reading and visual narrative reading, name inference when children use it, and introduce subtext via color/composition choices. |
| Surfing and Wave Sports | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No ocean science whatsoever. No wave physics, no buoyancy, no explanation of what a wave is or why a board floats. Coaching cues were procedural ("paddle like you're swimming") with no physics. A surfing lesson without wave physics is a major missed opportunity. | Rewrote summary with wave physics (energy not water moving, orbital motion, wind generation thousands of miles away) and buoyancy (Archimedes' principle, upward force on less-dense objects). Updated introduction to include a wave-energy demonstration (hand ripple in water). Updated skill practice to name buoyancy during board float and wave energy during each swell.

| Community Garden and Clean-Up Activities | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Plant biology was entirely surface-level: "seeds need soil, water, and sunlight to grow" with no mechanism. No germination, no radish/radicle, no decomposition, no soil ecology. Compost was in the vocabulary but never actually used in the activity. | Replaced vocabulary with germination (embryo waking up, radicle as first root), decomposition (bacteria/fungi/earthworms breaking organic matter to nutrients), compost (decomposition you can hold), cultivate (refined), stewardship (refined). Rewrote introduction to explain the seed embryo and endosperm (lunchbox for a baby plant). Updated discovery section with radicle, gravitropism ("why roots go down, shoots go up"), and earthworms as decomposers with nutrient cycling. |
| Dodgeball and Throwing Games | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No physics of throwing or catching. No parabolic arc, no projectile motion, no momentum, no hand-eye coordination neuroscience. Coaching cues were generic ("swing your arm like a pendulum") with no underlying physics explained. "Hand-eye coordination" named but mechanism never explained. | Rewrote summary with projectile physics (parabolic arc, gravity + forward momentum), the catching challenge (3D trajectory prediction as a real neural computation), and the explanation that struggling to catch isn't failure but a complex calculation. Updated skill breakdown to explain arc differences between throw types and that catching is prediction. Updated coaching cues to include "watch it the whole way — your brain needs the arc to predict landing" and "soft throw = gentle arc, hard throw = fast flat line." |
| How Languages Are Structured | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Missing key linguistics concepts: morpheme (smallest unit of meaning vs. phoneme as sound unit), overgeneralization (evidence of grammar rule learning rather than imitation), syntax differences across languages. Extension for multi-language comparison didn't explain why word order differs. | Rewrote summary with overgeneralization as the key evidence that children learn grammar rules (not imitate), and the universal features of all 7,000+ human languages (all have nouns and verbs, word order varies enormously). Replaced vocabulary with morpheme (meaning unit), syntax (word order rules, named after language type), overgeneralization (real examples: goed/mouses as rule-following not mistakes), and expanded grammar definition. Added morpheme exploration and word-order comparison (English SVO vs. Japanese SOV) to discovery section. Updated multi-language extension with actual syntax comparison across Japanese/Spanish/English. |

Words "crosse," "pocket," "cradling," or "crease" never appeared. | Added real lacrosse history (one of oldest North American sports, created by First Nations peoples, French name from la crosse = bishop's staff). Added vocabulary: crosse (the stick), pocket (the mesh net), cradling (rocking motion that keeps ball in pocket), crease (goal circle). Updated coaching cues to use "crosse" instead of "stick" and explain cradling. Added "Real Lacrosse: What to Know" section with sport facts. |
| Sailing and Wind Sports | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | Summary claimed "developing understanding of wind and physics" but never delivered any physics. No lift, drag, pressure differential, Bernoulli, or points of sail (running/reaching/beating). "See how the sail fills with wind? That's what makes the boat go" with no explanation of why. | Expanded summary to explain: wind as moving air molecules creating pressure, drag (wind pushing against surface) vs. lift (pressure differential from curved sail — same principle as airplane wings), and points of sail (running/reaching/beating). Updated introduction and coaching cues with lift/drag explanations. Updated sailboat coaching to name "reaching" and explain the curved sail as a wing generating lift. |
| Space and Astronomy Exploration | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Defined "twinkle" but never explained what a star actually IS (a massive sphere of plasma undergoing nuclear fusion).

Updated introduction and 3-4+ adaptations with cultural origins. |
| Ice Skating and Rink Activities | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No physics of why ice is slippery. The pressure-melts-ice myth is common but false — the quasi-liquid surface layer exists regardless of pressure. No blade edge mechanics (hollow grind, two edges), no skating history. | Added to summary: quasi-liquid surface layer (why the pressure myth is wrong; water molecules at ice surface are semi-liquid due to lack of neighbors above them), friction heat (thin water film during skating), blade edge mechanics (concave hollow grind creates two edges for grip and propulsion), 5,000-year history (bone blade skates from Finland). Updated introduction demonstration to explain the quasi-liquid layer and blade edges. |
| Human Impact on Nature | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Purely behavioral (pick up trash, water plants) with no ecology. No explanation of HOW pollution harms nature — no food chains, no ecosystem interconnection, no biodiversity concept, no microplastics, no habitat destruction. | Replaced vocabulary with: ecosystem (interconnected living community, bee/flower/fruit/animal web example), biodiversity (variety as resilience, rainforest vs. monoculture), habitat destruction (primary cause of extinction — losing home, food, and neighbors simultaneously), pollution types (plastic 400-1,000 year decomposition, microplastics in fish, fossil fuels CO₂, fertilizer runoff).

Coaching cues said "make yourself like a tree" and "the rope will help you up!" with no explanation of the physical mechanisms. | Added Key Concepts section with planing (hydrodynamic lift at sufficient speed, angled surface physics), drag (800x denser than air, why skis minimize drag), center of gravity (must stay over skis to avoid falling), and tension/force transfer (how boat energy reaches skier). Rewrote introduction to explain planing before the child enters water. Updated coaching cues with center of gravity language and lift explanation during speed-up. |
| Critical Thinking and Questioning | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary defined "question" as "a sentence that asks for information" (teaching nothing) and "reason" as "think carefully" (too vague). Missing the core critical thinking apparatus: observation vs. inference distinction, hypothesis, evidence, cause and effect, bias. Activity was mystery box play with no intellectual framework — just vague wondering. | Replaced vocabulary entirely with observation (direct sensory facts), inference (conclusion from evidence), hypothesis (testable educated guess), evidence, cause and effect, and bias (tendency distorting reasoning). Rewrote activity overview to explain the scientific method framework (observe → infer → hypothesize → test → revise). Updated exploration to explicitly teach the observation/inference distinction at every step. Updated discovery phase to introduce disconfirming evidence ("what would tell us we were wrong?") and bias identification. Updated wrap-up to name the process rather than praising children. Updated 3-4+ to require formal hypothesis format (prediction + reason) and introduce the scientific practice of writing hypotheses before testing. |
| Making Bead and Pasta Necklace Patterns | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Pattern vocabulary was decent (pattern, sequence, texture, symmetric) but missed that pattern-making is a direct algebraic precursor. AB/ABC/ABBA pattern type notation never introduced. Predictability — the mathematical value of patterns — never discussed. Symmetry mentioned without explaining axis of symmetry. Texture mentioned without explaining why pasta has ridges (manufacturing process). | Replaced vocabulary with pattern (mathematical definition with AB/ABC/ABBA notation), iteration (one complete repeating unit), predictability (the mathematical power of patterns — knowing what comes next without seeing it), sequence (not all sequences are patterns), texture (structural cause), and axis of symmetry (imaginary fold line). Rewrote exploration to name pattern types with mathematical notation and ask predictability questions. Updated 3-4+ to require pattern-type naming, teach axis of symmetry explicitly with folding test, and add predictability as the central concept. |
| Time and Duration (Physical Cycles, Sequences, Measurement) | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Note: a similarly-named lesson in Batch 25 was marked PASS; this is a distinct longer-titled file. This lesson had good bones (oscillation, atomic clocks, "where does time go?") but was missing circadian rhythm despite being explicitly about physical human cycles, entropy (the thermodynamic reason time has a direction), and time perception (the neuroscience of why time feels slow when bored and fast when engaged — a real, well-studied phenomenon). | Added circadian rhythm (suprachiasmatic nucleus, 24-hour biological clock), entropy (Second Law of Thermodynamics, why time has a direction, the sand castle analogy), and time perception (brain attention modulates time experience) to vocabulary. Added circadian rhythm content to discovery section with explicit mention that toddlers' rhythms are still maturing. Added time perception observation in discovery section. Substantially enhanced "where does time go?" challenge with entropy, Einstein relativity, and GPS satellite time dilation as accessible examples. |

| Lesson | Queue | Verdict | Issues Found | Fixed |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Outdoor Activities | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Generic sensory exploration with no ecology. Vocabulary (terrain, atmosphere, landscape, elements) sounded scientific but taught nothing real. Activities were "find something smooth/rough" — pure sensory play with no science. No ecosystem, habitat, decomposer, or adaptation content. | Replaced vocabulary with ecosystem, habitat, decomposer (with worms/pill bugs/fungi as real examples), adaptation. Rewrote activity around ecological observation: finding habitats, identifying decomposers in dead leaf litter, spotting plant and animal adaptations. Added food chain dependency reasoning and single-celled organism mention. |
| Book and Media Collection | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary (organize, collection, curate, archive) was introduced but never deployed meaningfully — activity was just sorting books by color or "silly vs. animals." No library science, no Dewey Decimal System, no metadata, no history of libraries or archives. | Replaced vocabulary with catalog, archive, classification (Dewey Decimal), metadata. Rewrote activity to teach real library science: reading book metadata (title/author/subject), building a classification system by subject, writing a simple catalog, and explaining what the Internet Archive does. Connected to Alexandria Library and digital search indexing. |
| Cell (Basic Unit of Life) | Knowledge | MINOR FIX | Core content was solid — real organelle names (nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes, cytoplasm) deployed throughout the activity. But vocabulary section had only generic terms (cell, living, organism, microscope) while actual organelle vocabulary was only in the activity body with brief descriptions. Missing single-celled organisms and cell division. | Replaced vocabulary section with nucleus, mitochondria, cell membrane, and organism (expanded to include single-celled organisms — bacteria). Added mention of single-celled organisms (bacteria as complete one-celled life) during discovery. Added cell division / mitosis to follow-up activities. |
| Heat and Cold | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Pure sensory play — touching warm and cold objects with no physics. Vocabulary included "sensation" instead of physics terms. No thermal energy, conduction, conductivity, or phase changes. No explanation of why metal feels colder than wood at the same temperature, why heat always flows hot→cold, or what a phase change is. | Replaced vocabulary with thermal energy (molecular kinetic energy), temperature (average molecular speed), conduction, thermal conductivity (why metal ≠ wood despite same temperature), phase change. Wrote three targeted physics experiments: conductivity comparison (metal vs. wood at same room temperature — same temp, different feel), heat-flow direction (hand loses heat to ice, not ice chilling hand), and phase change (ice melting as energy breaking crystal structure, why melting ice stays 0°C). |
| Dance Choreography and Routines | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | Solid structural content (session flow, safety, age adaptations) but taught "follow movements to music" rather than actual choreography. No choreographic vocabulary or concepts: motif, spatial levels, dynamics (sharp vs. flowing), 8-count phrasing, canon, unison vs. contrast. | Rewrote summary with real choreographic framing (space/time/energy). Updated introduction to teach 8-count phrasing, spatial levels (high/medium/low), and motif. Rewrote skill practice to build choreography using a recurring motif, contrasting movement, and dynamic variation. Updated 3-4+ adaptations with canon, unison vs. contrast, and child-invented motifs. |
| Leadership and Team Activities | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary was circular (leadership defined as "guiding others toward goals," cooperation as "working together"). No intellectual content about what leadership is, why groups need coordination, authority vs. leadership, or division of labor. Activities were art-making and block-stacking with generic "teamwork" prompts, no framework. | Replaced vocabulary with authority (role-based), leadership (trust and competence-earned), role (specific group job), consensus, division of labor. Rewrote activity introduction with contrast between bossy authority and real earned leadership. Added structured roles (architect, builder, stability checker, materials manager), mid-activity role rotation, debrief on whose idea actually solved the problem. Connected to real-world examples (firefighters, doctors who must listen to their teams). |
| Interview and Field Research Simulation | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Activity was "ask 3-4 questions and draw the answers" with no research methodology. No research question formulation, no open vs. closed question distinction, no bias, no primary source concept, no data analysis phase. All four vocabulary words were everyday synonyms for "asking questions." | Replaced vocabulary with research question, primary source, open question (vs. closed), data (field notes), bias (leading questions). Rewrote activity as a 5-step research process: (1) form research question, (2) learn open vs. closed and neutral vs. biased questions with live demonstrations, (3) conduct structured interview with field notes, (4) ask follow-up questions iteratively, (5) analyze patterns in collected data. Added "research always generates more questions" as conclusion. |

Real-world connections were superficial ("buildings have foundations like your blocks"). | Replaced vocabulary with gravity, compression, load, center of gravity, arch, engineer, foundation (with real definitions). Rewrote activity as three structured physics experiments: wide vs. narrow base (demonstrating center of gravity), compression (bottom block works hardest), and arch (Roman invention, 2,000-year-old aqueducts still standing). Added engineering thinking framework ("you're the engineer — test your hypothesis"). Updated coaching cues with physics language throughout. |
| Countries and Continents | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary included "discover" (non-geographic, non-technical). Missing the continent/country distinction (geographic vs. political), no hemispheres, no equator explaining climate, no borders as human decisions. Activity was pure "point at globe" with no deeper geographic reasoning. | Replaced vocabulary with continent, country (with explicit continent/country distinction via pizza analogy), equator (climate explanation), hemisphere, border (as human decision), latitude (climate predictor). Rewrote activity to explain the geographic vs. political distinction, equator effect on climate, one real fact about each continent (Africa 54 countries, Australia = single country, Antarctica = no countries), and borders as human inventions. Added continental drift as extension activity. |
| Cause and Effect (Physical Causation, Social Consequences, Logical Reasoning) | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Station descriptions described what happens without ever explaining WHY. Push → car moves, but no mention of force as the mechanism. Drop → falls, but gravity never named as the cause. Domino chain reaction described but energy transfer absent. Missing variables as a concept. | Added force, energy transfer, variable, and predict to vocabulary. Rewrote each station to explain the mechanism: Station 1 — force as cause of movement, direction changes with different force angles. Station 2 — gravity explicitly named as the cause of falling (with Galileo reference). Station 3 — energy transfer from finger to first domino traveling down the chain; gap-in-chain test added. Added controlled experiment extension (Variation 3) teaching one-variable-at-a-time principle. |
| Learning to Tie Knots and Bows | Knowledge | PASS | Already excellent. Vocabulary covered friction (as the actual mechanism knots rely on), overhand knot, crossing (mathematically defined), and topology (knot theory, DNA research application). Activity explicitly teaches friction at every step. Age adaptations reference knot theory for 3-4+. No changes needed. | N/A |
| Wrestling and Takedowns | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | Safety framework was solid but the physics was absent. No explanation of WHY the wrestling stance works (center of gravity, base of support). Leverage never explained as a physical principle. No historical context. Coaching cues were generic ("get low and balanced") with no underlying science. | Added wrestling's ancient history (ancient Egypt and Greece, 3,000+ years). Enriched introduction to explain center of gravity and base of support physics — with demonstration (narrow stance vs. wrestling stance push test). Added leverage as named concept ("technique beats muscle") to introduction. Updated skill breakdown with center of gravity and base of support definitions. Rewrote coaching cues and game variations to include physics language throughout. |
| Water Polo and Pool Games | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | No physics of water at all despite being an aquatic activity. "This is our water polo ball — it floats!" with no explanation of why. No buoyancy, no water density, no resistance. Real water polo's history and rules not mentioned. | Added buoyancy (Archimedes' principle, dense vs. less-dense objects), water density (800x denser than air as explanation for why water is harder to move through), lung buoyancy as a real experiment children can try. Rewrote introduction to explain: pop-up ball demonstrates upward buoyancy force, water resistance while walking, real water polo history (Olympic since 1900, treading water, no standing allowed). Updated skill breakdown and coaching cues with buoyancy and resistance language. |
| Reaction Time and Quick Response Games | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | The activity described a signal-response loop without explaining what reaction time actually IS. No actual reaction time numbers, no neural pathway (sensory → brain → muscle), no explanation of why sound responses are faster than visual, no mention of how practice physically changes the brain. | Added actual reaction time numbers (250ms visual, 170ms auditory) to summary. Rewrote introduction to explain the full neural pathway (sensory organ → nerve → brain → motor command → muscle), nerve speed (up to 70 m/s), and ruler-drop test as a real reaction time measurement. Added sound-vs-sight comparison experiment. Updated skill breakdown to label each step of the neural process. Updated coaching cues to narrate brain activity during each signal. Added neural rewiring explanation for why practice improves reaction time. |

| Customer Service Role-Play | Knowledge | PASS | Already uses real economic vocabulary (transaction, commerce, shopkeeper) with substantive definitions; activity genuinely teaches commercial exchange rather than just themed play | N/A |
| Collaboration and Cooperation | Knowledge | PASS | Exceptional — vocabulary cites Adam Smith's division of labor (1776) with actual pin-factory statistics; Norman Triplett's 1898 social facilitation research with brain chemistry (dopamine, norepinephrine); theory of mind with developmental timeline and chimpanzee comparison; free rider problem in 3-4+ adaptation | N/A |
| Services and Helping Others | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | All four vocabulary terms were soft social-emotional definitions with no economic or sociological content (service = "helpful job," community = "people in neighborhood," contribute = "give something helpful," appreciation = "feeling grateful"); activity was pure community-helpers matching with no intellectual substance — no economics, no real facts about what helpers know or do | Replaced vocabulary with specialization (with 10-year doctor training example), interdependence (food-supply chain example), service vs. product distinction, infrastructure; rewrote activity introduction to teach specialization; added real facts for each helper (firefighter oxygen/fuel/heat triangle, doctor bacteria vs. viruses, plumber gravity and pressure, Dewey Decimal System); updated 3-4+ adaptation to trace full interdependence chains and explain taxes/public services |

| Lesson | Queue | Verdict | Issues Found | Fixed |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Business Creation and Entrepreneurship Play | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary correct but lesson contained no real economics content — no profit, no cost, no supply/demand, no value. Activity was purely themed dramatic play with no explanation of why prices exist or how businesses actually work. | Added profit, cost, value, supply-and-demand vocabulary. Updated Discovery phase to explicitly introduce cost vs. selling price, profit calculation, and supply/demand scenarios. Updated 3-4+ age adaptation to include profit thinking and supply/demand exploration. |
| Computers and Machines | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Placeholder text left in vocabulary section ("Select 3-4 vocabulary words..."). Vocabulary was vague (technology = "things people made"); no mention of simple machines (lever, gear, wheel and axle), circuits, input/output, or processor. Activity was just touching toys with no explanation of how any machine actually works. | Removed placeholder. Replaced vocabulary with simple machine, gear, circuit, input/output, processor, mechanism — all with real definitions. Rewrote activity to explain gears interlocking, springs storing energy, circuits as complete loops, and computers processing input to produce output. Updated age adaptations to include hands-on circuit demos and simple machine scavenger hunt. |
| Resource Management Games | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Lesson was fundamentally about sharing/fairness (a social-emotional skill) rather than resource management economics. Missing the core concept that drives resource management: scarcity. No mention of trade-offs or opportunity cost. Activity was just counting and equal division with no constraint-based thinking. | Added scarcity, trade-off, and budget to vocabulary alongside allocate/prioritize/conserve. Rewrote activity to explicitly introduce scarcity as the reason resources need managing; added constraint-based scenarios requiring trade-off decisions; reframed discovery questions around why resources need managing and what trade-offs were made. |
| Interview Practice and Preparation | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary was entirely generic (interview, interviewer, communication, listen) — no real content about what makes interviews effective. Activity was just asking "what's your favorite food?" with no teaching of actual interview technique. No mention of open vs. closed questions, active listening, follow-up questions, or real-world interview contexts. | Replaced vocabulary with open-ended question, closed question, follow-up question, active listening — the actual concepts of effective interviewing. Updated activity to explicitly contrast open vs. closed questions and show why open-ended questions get richer answers. Added follow-up question practice and real-world context (journalism, science, medicine). |
| Library and Book Exploration | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary was almost entirely generic everyday words: "Explore" and "Imagination" are not literacy concepts at all. "Library" defined as just "a collection of books." No mention of fiction vs. non-fiction, genre, narrative structure, author/illustrator distinction, or how to use reference tools (table of contents, index). Activity was just "browse books and read together" with no intellectual framework. | Replaced vocabulary with fiction, non-fiction, genre, author, illustrator, narrative — real literacy concepts. Updated activity to include sorting books by fiction/non-fiction, demonstrating table of contents vs. absence of one, tracking narrative structure aloud, and using non-fiction as reference. |
| Mentoring Younger Children | Knowledge | FAIL -> FIXED | Vocabulary was four generic social-emotional words (mentor, responsibility, patience, leadership) with no real content about how teaching and learning actually work. Activity was essentially "pair an older and younger child together and let them play" with no conceptual framework about what makes mentoring effective as a learning mechanism. | Added scaffolding, modeling, observational learning, fading support vocabulary — the actual educational psychology behind mentoring. Rewrote activity to teach the older child the three-step mentor sequence (model → scaffold → fade support) explicitly. Activity now names what's happening as it happens ("that's scaffolding!") and asks the older child to observe when fading support enables more independent performance. |
| Skiing (Downhill and Cross-Country) | Physical | FAIL -> FIXED | Coaching cues gave only procedural instructions with no physics explanation ("Stand tall like a tree trunk!" vs. explaining center of gravity; "Make a pizza!" vs. explaining friction and momentum diversion). Despite the title, cross-country skiing was entirely absent — the lesson only covered downhill. | Rewrote coaching cues to explain why techniques work (wedge creates friction in two directions; bent knees lower center of gravity; leaning forward keeps ski tips down for control). Added cross-country skiing section explaining the fundamentally different mechanics (stride-and-glide, poles for propulsion, diagonal pattern, kick-zone grip vs. glide), including Newton's Third Law explanation for the kick. |
