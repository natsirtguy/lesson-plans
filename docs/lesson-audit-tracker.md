# Lesson Plan Intellectual Rigor Audit

Tracking file for auditing lesson plans against the educational philosophy of intellectual rigor (see CLAUDE.md). The goal is to ensure lessons use real terminology, include actual content rather than themed play, and trust children with genuine complexity.

## Audit Criteria

Each lesson is evaluated for:
1. **Real vocabulary** - Does the lesson use actual scientific/technical terms, or only everyday words?
2. **Substantive content** - Does the lesson teach real concepts, or is it just themed play with no intellectual payload?
3. **Complexity as backdrop** - Are activities enriched by real knowledge, or are they generic activities with a topic label?
4. **Trust in partial understanding** - Does the lesson introduce concepts that go beyond what a toddler will fully grasp, trusting that exposure has value?
