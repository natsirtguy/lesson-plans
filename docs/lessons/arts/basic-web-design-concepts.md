# ARTS & CULTURE ACTIVITY: Basic Web Design Concepts

## Activity Summary

In this unplugged, hands-on activity, children become web designers and architects without ever touching a computer. They'll create paper websites, design clickable buttons, draw layouts, and build web pages using blocks and craft materials. Through this tactile exploration, children learn real design thinking concepts like navigation, organization, visual hierarchy, and how information is structured—all while exercising creativity and problem-solving skills.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression, Design thinking, Role-playing, Exploration

**Duration**: 20-35 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Mess Level**: Low to Medium (paper, markers, tape, light crafting)

**Best Environment**: Indoor at table or large flat surface, or outdoor on a picnic blanket

## Complete Activity Setup

### Materials Needed

**Essential materials**:
- Large sheets of paper (white poster board, kraft paper, or 11x14" paper) - 2-3 sheets per child
- Colored markers, crayons, or colored pencils
- Safety scissors (child-safe)
- Tape (masking tape or painter's tape)
- Index cards or small paper squares for buttons
- Markers for labeling buttons
- Blocks (wooden blocks, plastic blocks, or foam blocks) - optional for layout exploration

**Optional enhancements**:
- Pre-printed wireframe templates (simple box outlines showing webpage layout)
- Stickers or stamps (to decorate and add visual interest)
- Yarn or string (to show connections between pages/links)
- Small brads or paper fasteners (to make moveable buttons)
- Magazine cutouts (for collage-style website design)
- Whiteboard or flip chart (to sketch ideas as a group first)

**Cost estimate**: Free to $5 (most materials are household items)

**Preparation time**: 5-10 minutes (assemble materials, prepare workspace)

### Step-by-Step Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Lay out all materials on table within reach of children
2. Protect the work surface with a large paper or plastic tablecloth if needed
3. Have scissors within safe reach, with supervision guidelines ready
4. If using brads, have a hole punch ready and supervise closely

**Environment setup**:
- Create an open, flat workspace where children can spread out their designs
- Arrange materials in a central location so children can self-select as needed
- Have examples nearby (can be simple sketches or photos of website homepages)
- Keep the area uncluttered so children can see and move between their creations

**Cleaning supplies ready**:
- Paper towels or cloth
- Trash bin
- Damp cloths for marker-stained hands
- Storage containers for leftover materials

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (3-4 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Start by asking: "Have you ever seen a website? What do you remember about it?" Listen to their descriptions of colors, pictures, buttons, words.
- Explain: "Today, we're going to become web designers and create our own websites—but instead of on a computer, we're going to design them on paper and with blocks. We get to decide where everything goes, what colors to use, and what buttons are on our website!"
- Show a simple example: "Let me show you what a website looks like. See how there's usually a big title at the top? And then pictures and buttons below? That's what we're going to create."
- Demonstrate: Hold up a sheet of paper and point to different areas: "Up here at the top is like the header—where the name and logo go. Down here are buttons that help you click and go to different parts. And here are pictures and words."

**Setting expectations**:
- "There's no right or wrong way to design a website. Your website is yours, and you get to decide what it looks like."
- "The fun part is thinking about where things go, what colors look good together, and what buttons you want people to click."
- "We're learning how designers think—how they organize things so people can use them."

### Main Activity (15-25 minutes)

**Phase 1: Exploration & Brainstorming** (4-6 minutes)
Children explore what a website could be and what they want theirs to feature.
- Ask open-ended questions: "What kind of website do you want to make? A website about animals? Your favorite foods? Your toys? A game? A store?"
- Show visual examples if helpful: pictures of actual websites on your phone (or drawn-out sketches if you want to keep it screen-free).
- Encourage: "You could make a website about anything you like!"
- What to observe: Which children have immediate ideas vs. those who need time to think? Are they thinking about content (what it's about) or visual design (how it looks)?

**Phase 2: Layout & Design** (8-12 minutes)
Children design their website layout on paper.
- Introduce the concept: "Every website has a layout—that's the plan for where things go. We're going to draw our layout first."
- Show simple wireframe thinking: Draw on a demo sheet while explaining: "Most websites have a big heading here [point to top]. Then maybe a picture or welcome message. Then buttons below [point to middle]. And maybe more information down here [point to bottom]."
- Demonstrate: Sketch a very simple example: a box at top (header), a larger box in middle (main content), smaller boxes at bottom (footer/links).
- Child's task:
  - Fold or draw boxes on their paper to plan their website layout
  - Decide: Where goes the title? Where go the pictures? Where go the buttons?
  - Start sketching or arranging their design
  - They can add details: colors, labels, buttons
- Questions to ask:
  - "What's the most important thing on your website? Where should it go so people see it first?"
  - "What buttons do you want? What will people click to do?"
  - "What colors make your website look nice?"
  - "What pictures or drawings will you include?"

**Phase 3: Interactive Elements** (4-6 minutes)
Children add clickable buttons and navigation elements.
- Introduce buttons: "Real websites have buttons you click. Let's make buttons for your website."
- Demonstrate: Cut out small rectangles from index cards, write labels like "Home," "About," "Play," "Shop," "Contact," etc.
- Child's task:
  - Create 2-4 buttons for their website on small cards
  - Write labels: what does each button do?
  - Decorate buttons with markers or stickers
  - Tape buttons onto their website design where they belong
  - Optional: Use brads to make buttons that can actually move/bend
- Extensions for more engagement:
  - Ask: "If someone clicks this button, where do they go?"
  - Create a "linked website": Make 2-3 pages (sheets of paper) and use string to show connections
  - Write simple text descriptions on each button

**Phase 4: Free Expression & Refinement** (remaining time)
Children finish and embellish their designs.
- Step back and let them lead—add more details, colors, decorations, additional buttons
- Encourage: "What else do you want to add? Does it tell your story?"
- If using blocks: Show how blocks can represent different sections of a layout: "This tower is the header, these blocks are the buttons, this is the main content area."
- Observe what children are proud of and engaged with

**Adult role**:
- During Phase 1: Listen, ask open questions, help them find their idea
- During Phase 2: Offer guidance on layout but let them make decisions about what goes where
- During Phase 3: Demonstrate button-making, then let them create independently
- Throughout: Narrate what you observe ("You're putting your biggest picture in the middle where it's the most important!"), ask thoughtful questions, praise process over perfection
- Step back: Let children work independently; offer support only when asked or stuck

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Gather children together and ask: "Who wants to show their website?"
- Children present their designs, explaining: What is their website about? What are the buttons? Where did they put things and why?
- Affirm: "You're thinking like real web designers! You organized everything so it makes sense."
- Reflection question: "What was fun about designing your own website? What would you change if you made another one?"

**Transition to cleanup**:
- Make cleanup part of learning: "Let's organize our materials like we'd organize a website—markers in one place, paper in another, tape in another."
- Children help gather materials
- Ask: "Where should this go?" helping them think about organization and categorization

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Approach**:
- Shorter, simpler activity: Focus on free drawing and exploration of shapes rather than structured "websites"
- Provide pre-drawn boxes/sections on paper so they color and fill in rather than creating structure
- Make buttons out of painted paper plates they can stack and arrange
- Use mostly markers and crayons (avoid scissors; you cut)
- Heavy emphasis on sensory/tactile experience and color choice rather than design thinking concepts
- Work alongside child; it's more collaborative play than independent design

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Adult support**: High—work together, focus on enjoyment and exploration rather than final product

### 3-4+ years
**Extensions**:
- Add more sophisticated layout thinking: multiple pages connected by links
- Challenge: "How many buttons should your website have? What should each one do?"
- Introduce vocabulary: "header" (top), "navigation" (buttons), "content" (main stuff), "footer" (bottom)
- Create a second webpage that connects to the first via string links
- Add simple written labels or signs
- Use blocks to build 3D website structures
- Challenge: "Design a website for someone else—what would they want to see?"
- Introduce the concept of ease-of-use: "Where should buttons be so people can find them easily?"

**Duration**: They may engage for 30-40 minutes or longer if interested

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Website for Someone Else**
Design a website for a specific person or character—maybe a website for their teddy bear, or a cafe, or a library. Who would visit this website? What would they want to find? This builds empathy and user-centered thinking.

**Variation 2: Multi-Page Website**
Create 2-3 connected pages. Use yarn or string to show how clicking a button takes you from one page to another. Children can walk along the "links" to show how the website works. This teaches navigation and interconnection.

**Variation 3: Website for Real Business**
Pick a familiar place (favorite restaurant, park, store) and design what THEIR website should look like. What pictures would they show? What buttons would people need? This applies design thinking to the real world.

**Variation 4: Interactive Website Build**
Use blocks to create a 3D "website structure" where children can physically move around the different sections. This is great for kinesthetic learners and adds another sensory dimension.

**Variation 5: Website in Nature**
Design a website using natural materials—leaves for buttons, rocks for organizing sections, branches to show connections. This combines outdoor exploration with design thinking.

**Thematic variations**:
- Seasonal: Design a website about fall/winter/spring/summer
- Holiday: Create a website for holiday celebration, gift shop, or winter wonderland
- Interest-based: Animal website, dinosaur site, favorite story character's page, space exploration page
- Community: Design a website for your classroom, library, or neighborhood park

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Web design is a modern form of visual communication and information architecture that's become central to how we share knowledge, tell stories, and connect with others globally. Even though young children aren't creating "real" websites, understanding design principles—organization, visual hierarchy, clear communication, user-centered thinking—are universal skills that apply to everything from book design to town planning to museum layouts. This activity introduces the concept that humans intentionally organize and design spaces and information so others can understand and use them. It's about communication and creative problem-solving.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Show examples of websites in different languages (even though children may not read them, the design speaks universally)
- Discuss how different websites look different based on their purpose (a children's site looks different from a news site)
- Talk about how designers think about people using their websites: "What colors work? How big should buttons be? Where do people look first?"
- If possible, explore designed spaces together (library, zoo, park) and notice how they're organized like websites—areas for different things, signs to help you navigate

**Books/Media**:
- "The Designer" series or design-focused picture books (search for children's books about design or architecture)
- Real websites (shown on screens as examples, though the activity is unplugged)
- Architecture and design conversations: "How did someone decide to arrange this room?"

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child has no idea what kind of website to design; feels overwhelmed
**Why**: Web design is abstract. Children benefit from concrete examples and direction.
**Solution**: Offer specific ideas to spark creativity: "You could make a website about dogs, or dinosaurs, or your favorite food. What do you like?" Start with their interests. It doesn't have to be a "real" business—it can be silly and fun. Role-play helps: "I'm visiting your website—what will I see first?"

**Challenge**: Child struggles with scissors or fine motor control
**Why**: Some 2-3 year olds aren't ready for scissors; motor skills are still developing.
**Solution**: You cut the buttons and paper pieces ahead of time. Child decorates and places them. For 3-4 year olds, guide hand-over-hand if needed, but let them participate. Consider pre-cut materials as a modification.

**Challenge**: Child tears paper, gets frustrated with layout
**Why**: Young children are still learning fine motor control and may be impulsive
**Solution**: Have extra paper available so it's okay to "start fresh." Tape can fix tears—make it part of the process. Keep it light and playful: "Oops, let's tape that!" Model problem-solving rather than perfection.

**Challenge**: Child wants to use screens/actual computer instead
**Why**: Young children in digital environments may assume computers are the "real" way
**Solution**: Frame this as a special activity: "Today, we're designers BEFORE computers. Real designers sketch on paper first, then use computers. You're doing what real designers do!" Make it feel special and valuable. It is—hands-on thinking and creativity are foundational.

### Tips for Success
- Start simple: Even a basic layout of boxes is perfect. Don't overcomplicate it.
- Ask open-ended questions: Instead of "is it good?" ask "what does your website do?" or "what did you like about designing it?"
- Celebrate thinking: "I love how you put the biggest picture in the middle! That makes people want to see it first."
- Let it be messy: Tape, markers, rough edges—it's all part of the creative process
- Connect to their world: "You know how you tap buttons on my phone? Your website has buttons too!"
- Have fun with role-play: Pretend to visit their website, click their buttons, ask what happens next
- Don't "improve" it: Let their design be theirs. Even if it doesn't look polished, their thinking is the goal

### What to Do With the Creation
- Display it on a wall or bulletin board—celebrate their design work
- Photograph it before it gets damaged (paper doesn't last forever)
- Create a "gallery opening": Invite family to visit all the websites and click buttons
- Keep it in a portfolio or folder to show growth over time
- Some children enjoy bringing it to school/preschool to show friends
- When you're ready to let go, recycle or reuse the paper
- Some children like to keep their "website" for days—that's beautiful. They're still thinking about it
