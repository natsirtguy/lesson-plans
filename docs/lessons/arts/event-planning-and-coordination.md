## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (3-5 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Ask the child about a special event they've attended: "Remember when we went to a birthday party? What did you like about it?"
- Build excitement: "We're going to plan our own special party! We get to decide everything!"
- Show examples of real invitations or simple decorated invitations you've made before
- Explain the main parts: who to invite, what to do, what to eat, what decorations to have

**Setting expectations**:
- "This is a pretend party we're planning - we can dream up anything we want!"
- "There's no wrong way to plan a party - you decide what makes it special"
- "We'll make invitations, plan decorations, and think about food"
- Emphasize fun and creativity over perfection

### Main Activity (20-25 minutes)

**Phase 1: Planning the Event** (5-7 minutes)
- Guide thinking about basic event elements through questions:
  - "What kind of party will it be?" (birthday, picnic, dancing, dinosaur theme, etc.)
  - "Who will come?" (family, friends, stuffed animals, pets, imaginary people)
  - "What color should we use?" (invitations, decorations)
  - "Will there be music? Dancing? Games?"
- Record child's ideas on a planning sheet as they talk
- Use simple drawings or words to capture their vision
- Celebrate their ideas: "That's a great idea for a dinosaur party!"

**Phase 2: Creating Invitations** (7-10 minutes)
- Provide blank cardstock for invitations
- Child decorates invitation with markers, stickers, pictures showing:
  - Type of event
  - Who it's for/from (simple names or pictures)
  - When (specific day or "soon")
  - What to wear or bring (optional)
- Demonstrate simple invitation format if helpful: "Who is invited? When? What will happen?"
- Encourage artistic choices: colors, decorations, special details
- Make multiple copies or create several invitations for different guests
- Optional: Child can practice "writing" names or details with inventive spelling/marks

**Phase 3: Planning Decorations and Details** (8-10 minutes)
- Discuss where party will be and what it will look like
- Create simple decorations together:
  - Banners using paper and markers
  - Streamer arrangements
  - Centerpieces with tissue paper flowers
  - Simple name cards for seating
- Create a simple menu on paper or index cards:
  - Draw favorite foods
  - Use stickers or pictures to show snacks
  - Write simple words (child dictates, you write)
- Organize materials: arrange invitations, put decorations together, group menu items
- Take a photo of the setup for documentation

**Adult role**:
- Ask planning questions to spark thinking but let child decide
- Serve as secretary: write down child's ideas and decisions
- Provide templates or suggestions only if child seems stuck
- Help organize materials without taking over the design
- Celebrate creativity and choices
- Model inclusive thinking ("Who would like to come? How can we make sure everyone has fun?")

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Invite child to explain their party plan: "Tell me about the party you planned. What's the most special part?"
- Review what you created together: "Look at all these invitations! They're so colorful!"
- Ask: "Would you like to have this party now (with dramatic play)? Or save these to show someone?"
- Discuss next steps: actual inviting of friends/family or transitioning to pretend play

**Transition to cleanup and play**:
- Child helps gather materials and organize them
- "Now let's set up our party!" - if transitioning to dramatic play with the invitations and decorations
- Store materials carefully if saving for actual event or dramatic play later

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Approach**:
- Focus on one element: either make invitations OR plan decorations (not both)
- Use mostly stickers, stamps, and picture placement rather than drawing
- Simplify the event concept: "We're making happy cards to show a party"
- Provide pre-made templates or outlines to fill in
- Use very concrete, familiar event types (birthday, picnic)
- Emphasize the sensory/creative aspect over planning logic

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Adult support**:
- Provide significant structure and guidance
- Pre-draw or pre-create basic outlines
- Mostly offer closed choices: "Stickers or markers? Red or blue?"
- Scribe all writing
- Focus on decoration and embellishment rather than planning

### 3-4+ years
**Extensions**:
- Plan more complex events with multiple elements (theme, games, food, decorations, guest list)
- Create a full event timeline or schedule
- Design a welcome sign or place cards with guests' names
- Plan simple "games" or activities for the party
- Create a shopping list for party supplies
- Make a budget and decide how to allocate resources
- Design thank-you cards for guests
- Include reading invitations aloud with expression
- Create a party favor or goodie bag design

**Duration**: 30-40 minutes or spread across multiple sessions

**Independence**: Child largely directs planning with prompting questions from adult

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1 - Actual Event Planning**:
Use these planning skills for a real event: plan a small birthday celebration, tea party, or family gathering. Have child help with actual invitations to send (with your help), actual decoration setup, and food preparation. Makes the learning tangible and meaningful.

**Variation 2 - Holiday Party Planner**:
Create event plans for upcoming holidays: Christmas party, New Year's celebration, Valentine's party, Fourth of July picnic. Incorporates cultural/seasonal themes. Create a portfolio showing how different holidays are celebrated.

**Variation 3 - Puppet Show Planner**:
Plan a puppet show event: design invitations, make decorations, plan the story/performance, arrange seating. Combines planning with performance and creative storytelling. Helps child understand events can center on different types of activities.

**Variation 4 - Restaurant/Cafe Planner**:
Plan opening a pretend restaurant: design a menu, create table decorations, make place cards, plan what music plays. Extends into dramatic play where child can be host/server/customer in their planned space.

**Variation 5 - Neighborhood Party Planner**:
Create a community event plan: design a neighborhood block party, community garden gathering, or park celebration. Incorporates ideas about bringing people together, which is broader than just personal parties.

**Thematic variations**:
- Seasonal parties (summer beach party, winter snow party, spring garden party, fall harvest party)
- Themed celebrations (dinosaur party, space party, jungle party, ocean party)
- Cultural celebrations from the child's heritage or families represented in their community
- Story-based parties (recreate a party from a favorite book)

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Event planning and coordination are central to how all human cultures mark important milestones and create community. From intimate family gatherings to large cultural festivals, the ability to organize people, resources, and time to create joyful shared experiences is fundamental to human connection. Teaching children to plan events gives them tools to create belonging and celebration, skills that are valued across all cultures. The practice of gathering together for celebration strengthens social bonds and transmits cultural values and traditions.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Explore celebration styles from different cultures: weddings, coming-of-age ceremonies, harvest celebrations, religious holidays, seasonal festivals
- Discuss how different families celebrate milestones and what's important in each celebration
- Research and share traditions from cultures represented in the classroom or community
- Talk about how different cultures organize their celebrations - what's similar, what's different
- Involve families in sharing how they celebrate important events

**Books/Media**:
- "Celebration" series showing different cultural celebrations
- "The Best Birthday Party Ever" and similar story-based party planning books
- Cultural celebration books showing real celebrations from around the world

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child's event plan is unrealistic or overly simple
**Why**: Children this age have limited experience with event logistics and may either dream very big or think only of one element.
**Solution**: Neither is a problem! If the plan is unrealistic, celebrate the imagination: "A party with a dinosaur AND space theme - that sounds fun! What would happen first?" If too simple, ask guiding questions: "You said cake - what else do people do at parties? What do you like doing?" There's no "right" complexity level.

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated with the creation process - invitations don't look how they imagined
**Why**: Fine motor skills and artistic output often don't match vision. Child may be comparing to adult-made examples.
**Solution**: Celebrate function over appearance: "Your invitation clearly shows it's a party - look at all the colors and fun stickers!" Use stickers and pictures to reduce drawing requirements. Emphasize that the point is the planning, not the appearance.

**Challenge**: Child loses focus or gets overwhelmed by too many choices
**Why**: Multiple stations and many materials can be overstimulating. Decision-making fatigue is real at this age.
**Solution**: Reduce choices: work on one element at a time. Focus on one invitation, then move to decorations, then menu. Offer closed choices rather than open-ended ones. Break activity into two shorter sessions rather than one long one. Keep the overall event concept simple.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't want to "clean up" the party and move on - keeps wanting to play
**Why**: The planning is fun, but pretend play is even more engaging. Child wants to continue the experience.
**Solution**: This is wonderful! Transition into dramatic play using the created materials: "Let's invite your stuffed animals to this party you planned!" Use the invitations, decorations, and menu in pretend play. This extends the learning and makes planning feel purposeful.

### Tips for Success
- Start with a familiar event type the child has experienced (birthday, picnic)
- Use a planning sheet or board where you record ideas visually - child can see their ideas becoming real
- Keep materials organized by type so child can make choices easily
- Use many different decoration methods (stickers, markers, pictures) to accommodate different preferences
- Reference real invitations or event examples to spark ideas, but don't use them as models to copy exactly
- Involve the child in creating the event if possible - it makes their planning meaningful
- Celebrate the planning process itself, not just the end product
- Let the event planning extend into dramatic play - this is where much of the learning happens

### What to Do With the Creation
- Display invitations and decorations if this is a real event coming up
- Use them in dramatic play: set up the planned party with stuffed animals, dolls, or action figures as guests
- Take photos of the planning process and finished materials for a portfolio
- If creating an actual party, keep the child's materials and display them at the real event
- Create a "party planning portfolio" showing different events child has planned
- Let child give real invitations they helped create to family members
- Store materials if planning to recreate or plan another similar event
- Don't worry about keeping these materials long-term - the experience and learning are what matter most
