# ARTS & CULTURE ACTIVITY: Interview and Field Research Simulation

## Activity Summary

In this activity, children become young researchers and journalists, conducting simple "interviews" and collecting information from their environment using child-friendly research methods. Kids will practice asking questions, listening carefully, and recording observations through drawing, photos, or simple notes - developing early inquiry skills, communication abilities, and curiosity about the world. This activity introduces the joy of discovery and the research process in age-appropriate ways, building confidence as learners and investigators.

**Activity Type**: Research practice / Social communication / Cognitive investigation

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Mess Level**: Low - primarily paper, drawing materials, and conversation

**Best Environment**: Indoor at table or outdoor in natural space; flexible setting

### Step-by-Step Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Identify 1-2 "interview subjects" (family members, stuffed animals, pets, or neighborhood people with permission)
2. Prepare 3-4 simple, open-ended questions (what is your favorite...? what do you like to do...? can you show me...?)
3. Decide on recording method (drawing, writing, photos)

**Environment setup**:
- Clear table space for paper and drawing materials
- Arrange seating so child can see both interviewer and recorder
- Outdoors: choose interesting area with varied features to observe
- Indoors: set up in living area or kitchen where family members are accessible

**Cleaning supplies ready**:
- Paper towels
- Pencil sharpener (if needed)
- Trash container nearby

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- "Today we're going to be researchers and investigators, just like people who ask questions and learn about the world!"
- Show the notebook/clipboard: "These are our research tools - we'll use them to collect information"
- Demonstrate asking one simple question aloud and how you'll record the answer
- Ask: "What do you want to learn about today?"

**Setting expectations**:
- "We're going to ask some questions and listen carefully to the answers"
- "We'll draw or write down what we learn"
- "Everyone's answers are interesting and important for our research"

### Main Activity (10-20 minutes)

**Phase 1: Prepare for Research** (2-3 minutes)
Free exploration of the research task
- Examine the notebook and pencils
- Look at the questions together
- Walk around the environment to observe
- Talk about what they notice: "What do you see? What looks interesting?"

**Phase 2: Conduct Interviews/Observations** (6-10 minutes)
Child practices asking and recording
- Ask the first question to the interview subject (family member, pet, nature observation)
- Child listens carefully to the response
- Child records answer through: drawing, writing, photos, or pointing
- Move through 3-4 prepared questions
- Offer prompts: "That's interesting! Can you tell me more?" "What made you choose that?"
- Pause between questions to let child process and record

**Phase 3: Exploration and Discovery** (remaining time)
Child's own investigation
- Switch roles: "Now you ask me questions!"
- Explore answers that surprised or interested them
- Continue observing and recording
- Follow child's curiosity: "You noticed that - what else do you see?"

**Adult role**:
- Ask open-ended questions to prompt deeper thinking
- Scribe for younger children who can't write yet
- Model active listening and genuine interest
- Comment on observations without judgment
- Help organize findings on chart paper or notebook

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Review the notebook together: "Look what we discovered!"
- Ask: "What was the most interesting thing we learned?"
- Share findings with others: "Let's tell [family member] what we researched"
- Celebrate as researchers: "You did great research today!"

**Transition to cleanup**:
- "Let's put our research tools away safely"
- Child helps organize papers and materials
- Discuss preserving findings: "Should we keep this in a special folder?"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Approach**:
Simplify to observation and very brief interactions; focus on what the child notices rather than formal questions. Use pictures/pointing instead of writing. Interview familiar objects or pets rather than people. Keep to 1-2 "questions" or observations.

**Key modifications**:
- One-word or very simple questions: "What color?" "What sound?" "What's soft?"
- Record through photos or pointing
- Very brief observation periods (5-8 minutes)
- Celebrate noticing: "You saw the bird! It's flying!"

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

**Adult support**: High - you ask the questions and record; child points/observes

### 3-4+ years
**Extensions**:
Add more complex questions and independence in asking. Introduce simple mapping or note-taking. Allow children to interview multiple people or conduct longer nature observations. Record findings in multiple ways.

**Additional techniques**:
- Write questions together beforehand
- Child asks questions with your support
- Record responses in words and pictures
- Create simple charts of findings ("Everyone likes...")
- Conduct multiple interviews and compare answers

**Duration**: They may engage 20-25 minutes or longer

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Nature Detective**
Focus entirely on outdoor observation. "Interview" the garden, a tree, or a small natural area. Record what you see, hear, and find. Create a nature finding chart.

**Variation 2: Family Historian**
Ask family members about their favorite memories, places they've lived, or things they like to do. Record stories and answers. Create a family discoveries book.

**Variation 3: Pet Researcher**
Focus on observing and recording a family pet's behaviors. What does it like? When is it most active? What sounds does it make? Become a pet behavior expert.

**Variation 4: Neighborhood Explorer**
Take the research outdoors to observe the neighborhood. Interview neighbors (with permission), observe buildings or landscapes, record discoveries with photos or drawings.

**Thematic variations**:
- Seasonal observers: Research how nature changes (spring flowers, winter snow)
- Community explorers: Interview people in different roles (gardener, mail carrier, baker)
- Sensory investigators: Research what you can see, hear, smell, touch, taste in a place

## Cultural Context

**Why this activity matters in human culture**:
Asking questions and collecting information is fundamental to human learning across all cultures. From anthropologists documenting different ways of life to journalists telling important stories to everyday people sharing family histories, the practice of respectful inquiry and careful listening is valued worldwide. This activity introduces children to these human practices of learning, documentation, and knowledge-sharing.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Show examples of different research methods across cultures (Aboriginal dot paintings record knowledge, oral histories preserve family stories in many African cultures)
- Interview family members about their own cultural backgrounds and traditions
- Research how different communities solve problems or celebrate
- Explore different ways people document and share knowledge

**Resources**:
- "Goodnight Moon" by Margaret Wise Brown - observational rhythm
- "National Geographic Little Kids" magazines - visual research and exploration
- "The Day the Crayons Quit" - perspective-taking and interviewing

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't ask questions or seems shy
**Why**: Some children need time to warm up to research activities; asking questions feels uncomfortable or they may not understand how to form them.
**Solution**: Start by asking simple questions aloud yourself and recording responses. Let the child just listen and observe at first. Gradually invite them to ask one question. Keep it low-pressure and playful.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or won't sit with the activity
**Why**: Young children have short attention spans; formal activities can feel boring if they're not directly engaging with something they care about.
**Solution**: Follow the child's interests - research what THEY want to learn about. Mix interview time with hands-on exploration. Make it active and movement-based rather than sitting still the whole time.

**Challenge**: Child wants to record in ways that don't match your expectations (scribbles, nonsense, wandering off-topic)
**Why**: Young children's research methods aren't like adults' - their focus is on the process and what captures their interest, not producing neat results.
**Solution**: Celebrate their method! Scribbles are valid research records. Ask them to "read" their notes back to you. Let them lead where the investigation goes.

### Tips for Success
- Keep questions open-ended: "What did you notice?" rather than "Is it big?"
- Model genuine curiosity - your enthusiasm is contagious
- Accept all answers as valid contributions to the research
- Take photos of their work and process - documentation matters
- Create a simple "researcher" identity - wear a pretend ID badge or use a special notebook

### What to Do With the Creation
- Keep findings in a special folder labeled "Our Research" or "Our Discoveries"
- Display findings on a bulletin board or refrigerator with the heading "We Researched..."
- Share findings with family members during dinner or family meetings
- Reference findings in future activities: "Remember when we researched...?"
- Photograph pages before moving on to preserve the work
- Use findings as conversation starters: "What if we researched...next time?"
