# ARTS & CULTURE ACTIVITY: Investment and Savings Games

## Activity Summary

In this activity, children learn foundational concepts about earning, saving, spending, and growing money through playful, hands-on games using pretend money, tokens, or real (supervised) coins. Children engage in economic decision-making, delayed gratification, and understanding that resources can grow over time when managed thoughtfully. This activity builds early financial literacy while developing math skills, planning abilities, and understanding of value and trade.

**Activity Type**: Practical and Productive - Economic Activities / Social and Cultural Practice

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Mess Level**: Low - minimal physical mess, though tokens/coins may scatter

**Best Environment**: Indoor at table / Flat play surface for organizing money/tokens

## Complete Activity Setup

### Materials Needed

**Essential materials**:
- Pretend play money (paper bills or coins, or printed play money)
- Alternative tokens (buttons, beads, blocks, or poker chips) - 50-100 pieces per child
- Small containers or pouches for "savings" (cups, small bowls, fabric pouches)
- Simple items to "purchase" or trade for (toy figures, small blocks, snacks, stickers)
- Price labels or cards (can be handwritten or printed)

**Optional enhancements**:
- Toy cash register or counting tray
- Piggy bank or decoration for savings container
- Chart paper for tracking savings progress
- Reward stickers or certificates for reaching savings goals
- Pictures of things they might "save for" (bicycle, playground equipment, toy)
- Simple counting or number cards (1-10)

**Cost estimate**: Free to $5 (most materials from household items or can be printed)

**Preparation time**: 10-15 minutes

### Step-by-Step Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Gather or print pretend money/tokens - enough for multiple transactions per child
2. Create price tags for 3-5 simple items or activities (realistic prices: 5-15 tokens each)
3. Set up small containers labeled "My Savings" and "To Spend Today"
4. Arrange items for "purchase" or select activities (5-minute timer activity, snack choice, toy selection, sticker, etc.)
5. Prepare optional tracking chart if using visual progress monitoring

**Environment setup**:
- Place all materials at accessible height for children
- Create defined areas: "Shop," "Savings Bank," and personal workspace for each child
- Ensure clear sight lines so you can observe all transactions
- Have extras of small "purchase items" in case multiple children want the same thing

**Cleaning supplies ready**:
- Small basket or container to collect stray coins/tokens
- Labeled storage containers for putting materials away
- Simple inventory check at cleanup time (count tokens back into container)

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (3-5 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- "Today we're going to be smart shoppers and money managers! We'll have pretend money that we can spend on things we want, or save for something even bigger."
- Show the "shop" with available items and their prices
- "Some of you might want to buy something right now. Other people might want to save their money to get something better later. What do YOU want to do?"
- Demonstrate putting money into savings container: "Watch - I'm putting some of my money here where it stays safe. Later, I can use it for something special."

**Setting expectations**:
- "Money is for trading - we use it to get things we need or want"
- "If you spend all your money now, you won't have any for later. If you save, you can get bigger things"
- "Everyone makes their own choices about spending or saving - both are okay!"

### Main Activity (15-20 minutes)

**Phase 1: Introduction to Earnings and Value** (3-5 minutes)
Free exploration - what child does:
- Each child receives their starting "money" (can frame as: "You earned this money!" or "Here's your allowance!")
- Children examine money, count it, feel it, organize it
- Introduce the "shop" and what things cost
- What to observe and comment on:
  - "I see you counting your money carefully"
  - "You're looking at all the things you could get"
  - "This costs 5 tokens and that costs 10 tokens"

**Phase 2: Making Spending Choices** (5-8 minutes)
Introduce technique or approach:
- Demonstrate: "I have 20 tokens. This toy costs 5 tokens. If I buy it, I'll have 15 left. What will I do with my 15 tokens?"
- Model decision-making aloud: "Hmm, I could buy one toy now, or I could save my money to buy TWO toys later. What do you think is a good idea?"
- Invite each child to make one purchase decision:
  - Will they spend now or save?
  - If spending, what will they buy?
  - How much will they have left?
- How child experiments:
  - Count out money for purchase
  - Trade money to "shopkeeper" (adult or another child)
  - Take item or mark choice
  - Observe remaining money
- Questions to ask:
  - "How much money do you have left?"
  - "Could you buy something else with what's left?"
  - "Why did you choose to save that money?"
  - "What are you saving for?"

**Phase 3: Free Exploration and Repeat Transactions** (7-10 minutes)
Child's own interpretation:
- Children continue making purchase and saving decisions at their own pace
- Introduce "Growth" concept: "Every few minutes, people who saved money get a bonus! It's like money grows when you keep it safe." (Add a few extra tokens to savings containers)
- Allow multiple rounds of earning, saving, and purchasing
- Children who finish early can:
  - Help run the "shop"
  - Count total savings
  - Set new savings goals ("I want to save 30 tokens")
  - Teach a friend
- What to encourage:
  - Conversation about choices: "Tell me about your money decisions"
  - Celebrating both savers and spenders: "You enjoyed that toy right away!" and "You're working toward your goal!"
  - Comparing amounts: "You have more saved than last time!"
  - Planning: "What will you save for next?"
- When to step back:
  - Once children understand transactions, let them negotiate with each other
  - Observe rather than direct constant praise
  - Intervene only if disagreements arise or if child is excluded

**Adult role**:
- Act as "shopkeeper" initially, then hand off to children
- Guide thinking without telling them what to do
- Ask questions that help children reflect on choices
- Celebrate all decision-making (spending and saving)
- Help resolve conflicts about fairness or trades
- Keep games moving with new "growth rounds" if energy dips

- What to avoid:
  - Judging choices ("Saving is ALWAYS better" or "You should buy that")
  - Pressure to save or spend in particular ways
  - Making this about "right answers" - both saving and spending have value
  - Complex math that overwhelms young learners

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- "Let's see how much money everyone saved today!"
- Children count their savings containers and share amounts
- Ask reflection questions: "Who saved the most? Did you spend money or save it? What was hard about saving? What was fun about buying something?"
- Share what each child chose: "You saved for a future goal" or "You enjoyed your purchase right away"
- "Money games help us learn to make choices. Both savers and spenders made good choices today!"

**Transition to cleanup**:
- Make cleanup part of the economic lesson: "Let's count all the tokens as we put them back. We want to make sure we have 100 tokens total when we're done."
- Children help sort money/tokens back into containers
- Count together for accuracy and a final math moment
- "You took care of our money very carefully!"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Approach**:
- Simplify to basic cause-and-effect: Money → Purchase
- Use only 2-3 items for "purchase" (avoid too many choices)
- Focus on the sensory/physical experience of handling money and trading
- Very short rounds (2-3 transactions maximum per child)
- Reduce quantities: 10-15 tokens per child instead of 30+
- Frame as pure play/trading, not yet about "saving for later"
- Caregiver does most of the "shopkeeping" - child focuses on trading

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes with frequent breaks

**Adult support**: High - model each step, hand-over-hand counting support, frequent verbal celebration

### 3-4+ years
**Extensions**:
- Introduce delayed gratification explicitly: "If you save for 2 more rounds, you can buy the BIG toy"
- Add complexity: "This costs 10 tokens OR 2 big tokens" (equivalent value practice)
- Create a tiered reward system: Small purchase = 5 tokens, Medium = 15 tokens, Premium = 30 tokens
- Introduce "earning" rounds: "Everyone who helped clean up earns 5 bonus tokens"
- Add "growth": "All saved money grows by 1 extra token each turn" (compound interest concept)
- Role-play stores where children take turns being shopkeeper
- Create a "savings goal" chart with pictures of what they're saving toward
- Introduce "jobs" to earn money: Organize blocks, count items, help a friend
- Play multiple rounds with running totals

**Duration**: 25-30 minutes or longer for engaged 3-4 year-olds

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Time-Limited Shopping**
Set a timer for when the "shop" closes. Children must decide quickly whether to shop now or save. Adds urgency and real-world planning.

**Variation 2: Auction Game**
Items have variable prices based on "demand." Popular items cost more if multiple children want them. Teaches value and negotiation.

**Variation 3: Cooperative Savings Goal**
Everyone saves toward a GROUP goal (20 tokens = shared snack time, or group outing). Teaches teamwork and shared responsibility.

**Variation 4: Job Board**
Create a "job" station where children can earn tokens: Sort buttons, build a tower, sing a song, find items. Connects saving/earning directly.

**Variation 5: Seasonal Savings Drives**
"Holiday coming! Everyone save for a special gift" or "Save for a field trip snack." Frames savings around meaningful goals.

**Thematic variations**:
- Treasure hunt: "Save tokens to buy map pieces and find treasure"
- Restaurant/Cafe: Money purchases menu items, children decide to dine or save
- Garden center: "Plants cost money; save to grow a garden"
- Pet store: "Adopt a pet, then earn money for pet supplies"

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Concepts of earning, saving, and spending vary dramatically across cultures and time periods. Throughout human history and across cultures, understanding resource management has been critical to survival and thriving. From traditional barter systems to modern banking, children worldwide begin learning economic concepts through play and observation. This activity honors the reality that economic decision-making is something all humans must navigate.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Discuss different ways people earn money (farming, business, trade, art, service)
- Explore how different cultures approach spending and saving (some prioritize community giving, others individual savings)
- Share stories: "In some countries, people trade without money" or "Many families prioritize saving for education"
- Invite families to share their own financial values and practices
- Read books featuring diverse economic scenarios and characters

**Books/Media**:
- "Elmer and Pigburt's Money" by Salina Yoon - about a pig saving for something special
- "The Berenstain Bears' New Baby" (includes themes of resource management) by Stan and Jan Berenstain
- "A Chair for My Mother" by Vera B. Williams - beautiful story of a family saving together for something meaningful

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to spend ALL money immediately and won't save
**Why**: Young children live in the present moment; delayed gratification is developmentally challenging. Some children are natural "spenders."
**Solution**: Don't force saving. Celebrate their choice. Try framing saving as game strategy ("Let's see if we can get 20 in your bank by tomorrow") rather than moral duty. Some children naturally prefer immediate joy.

**Challenge**: Child gets upset when money "runs out" after spending
**Why**: Child may not understand cause-and-effect between spending and having less, or may experience regret
**Solution**: Offer a gentle do-over with new money. Ask: "What would you do differently?" Normalize both emotions. Next round, offer to help them "plan" before spending.

**Challenge**: Conflict over fairness ("He got more money than me!" or "I wanted that toy!")
**Why**: Young children have emerging concepts of fairness; competition for limited resources is real
**Solution**: Acknowledge feelings: "You're frustrated you couldn't get that toy. There are other toys you might like." If needed, rotate special items or have duplicates. Use this as a teaching moment, not a problem.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand the exchange transaction
**Why**: Abstract concept of "money = value = item" requires cognitive development
**Solution**: Use concrete language and repetition: "You're trading 5 tokens for this toy. The toy is now yours. You have 5 fewer tokens." Let child handle and count through each transaction.

**Challenge**: One child dominates transactions/being shopkeeper
**Why**: Some children love having power/control; some are more assertive
**Solution**: Set clear turn-taking: "Everyone gets to be shopkeeper for 3 customers." Rotate roles explicitly. Support less assertive children in speaking up about their choices.

### Tips for Success
- Start with very simple transactions (1-2 items available) before expanding to complex choices
- Use physical tokens/money, not just abstract numbers - children need to see and touch value
- Celebrate thoughtful decision-making, not just "good" outcomes. "You thought about your choice" matters as much as "You saved wisely"
- Keep quantities small enough that children can count or understand totals without frustration
- Allow multiple rounds so children get comfortable with transactions before deeper decision-making
- Role-model authentic reflection: "I spent my money and now I don't have any. Next time I might save some"
- Connect to real life: "Remember when we saved our tokens? Families save money for things they want too"
- For younger children (2-3), keep it simple and sensory-focused; skip the "philosophy" of saving

### What to Do With the Creation
- **Take photos**: Document children's "shops," their money counts, their choices on a chart
- **Create a ledger**: Simple tracking of "started with 20 tokens, spent 5, has 15 left" - visually shows math
- **Display savings goals**: If children created goals, save those pictures and track progress over multiple sessions
- **Family sharing**: Send home brief note: "Today we played money games! Your child chose to [save/spend]. You might ask them what they'd do with money at home"
- **Repeat and refine**: Keep tokens/money stored in clear containers; this game is great for repeat play as understanding deepens
