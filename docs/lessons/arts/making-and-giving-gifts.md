## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Show a simple handmade gift (a decorated paper heart, a painted rock, a sticker picture) and describe who it could be for
- Talk warmly about giving gifts: "When we make something special with our hands and give it to someone we care about, it makes them happy"
- Ask the child: "Who would you like to make a gift for today? A friend? A family member? A teacher?"
- Offer 2-3 simple gift ideas: decorated paper, painted rock, gift picture

**Setting expectations**:
- Emphasize that homemade gifts are special because they're made with love and care
- Explain that the process of making is more important than perfection
- Introduce the basic steps: choose, decorate, wrap (if desired)

### Main Activity (15-25 minutes)

**Phase 1: Choosing and Planning** (2-3 minutes)
- Child decides who will receive the gift (adult can help brainstorm)
- Child chooses what type of gift to make: a picture, a decorated box, a card, a decorative item
- Talk about what the recipient likes (their favorite colors, animals, activities) to inspire design choices
- This helps develop empathy and thoughtfulness

**Phase 2: Creating the Gift** (10-15 minutes)
- Child begins with base material (paper, card, or small box)
- Introduce techniques naturally as child engages:
  - Coloring and drawing with crayons or markers
  - Gluing on decorative items (stickers, foam shapes, pom-poms)
  - Tearing and arranging tissue paper for texture
  - Stamping patterns with foam stamps
- Ask guiding questions: "What colors do you think they'll like?" "What should we add next?"
- Model techniques without taking over: show how to apply glue, cut paper, arrange decorations
- Allow child to make choices about design and decoration
- Celebrate effort and choices: "You chose red because it's their favorite color! That shows you're thinking about them"

**Phase 3: Finishing and Wrapping** (3-5 minutes)
- Help child decide if gift needs additional embellishments
- If wrapping, guide child to place gift in bag or wrap with tissue paper
- Optional: Create a label or card to accompany the gift with child's name or a simple message
- Child can sign or decorate the gift card with stickers or drawings

**Adult role**:
- Facilitate rather than direct - ask open-ended questions instead of giving instructions
- Model enthusiasm about gift-giving and generosity
- Support fine motor skills without taking over the creative process
- Manage materials and help with difficult tasks (cutting thick materials)
- Provide genuine praise for effort, choices, and thoughtfulness shown

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Discuss the finished gift together: "Tell me about your gift. Why did you choose these colors?"
- Talk about how the recipient will feel: "They're going to be so happy to receive something you made"
- If possible, create a plan for gift delivery: "We can give this to them tomorrow" or "We can bring this to school"

**Transition to cleanup**:
- Invite child to help clean up: "Let's put away the materials together"
- Child can throw away scraps, place materials back in containers, and help wipe the table
- Make cleanup feel like part of the caring process: "Cleaning up shows we respect our space"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Approach**:
- Provide pre-cut shapes (hearts, circles) that require only decorating, not cutting
- Offer large stickers and foam shapes that are easier to manipulate than small details
- Use thick paintbrushes with washable paint instead of markers for broader strokes
- Keep the process simple: coloring + one decorative element (stickers OR glue + shapes, not both)
- Stay close by to provide hand-over-hand assistance as needed with glue application
- Use simple language: "Let's make something pretty for Grandma"
- Accept scribbles and simple designs as complete and wonderful

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes (shorter attention span; may need breaks)

**Adult support**: High - provide frequent verbal encouragement, model techniques, assist with glue and fine motor tasks

### 3-4+ years

**Extensions**:
- Offer child-safe scissors to cut paper into shapes (with guidance)
- Introduce multi-step projects: drawing + gluing + stamping + wrapping
- Encourage writing or dictating messages/names on gift cards
- Suggest more complex designs: creating patterns, mixing media (markers + stickers + tissue paper)
- Support child in deciding layout before gluing: "Where will you put the stickers?"
- Ask more complex questions about recipient preferences and gift planning
- Provide options for different gift types: decorated box, gift bag, greeting card, picture frame

**Duration**: 25-30 minutes (can sustain focus longer and engage in more steps)

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Gift-giving is a universal human practice found across all cultures. It represents care, connection, gratitude, and community bonds. In many cultures, handmade gifts hold special meaning because they represent time, effort, and personal thought. Teaching children to give gifts fosters understanding of generosity, empathy, and social reciprocity. It introduces the concept that the value of a gift lies in the gesture and relationship, not the material worth.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Discuss how different cultures celebrate gift-giving: examples include bringing gifts to hosts in many cultures, gift-wrapping traditions, seasonal giving practices
- Explore how handmade gifts are valued differently in various communities (some cultures treasure handmade items as family heirlooms)
- Share stories of gift-giving from different cultural traditions
- Create gifts inspired by diverse artistic traditions and materials

**Books/Media**:
- "The Giving Tree" by Shel Silverstein - explores generosity and giving over time
- "Little Owl's Night" by Divya Srinivasan - features sharing and thoughtfulness between animal friends

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child tears or crumples paper during gluing, becomes frustrated
**Why**: Fine motor control is still developing; children may apply too much glue or have difficulty managing paper while gluing
**Solution**: Pre-cut shapes into smaller, more manageable pieces. Use glue sticks instead of liquid glue for easier control. Show child how to hold paper with one hand while applying glue with the other. Normalize mistakes: "Let's use this in the design - it makes it unique!"

**Challenge**: Child wants to give gifts but has difficulty choosing a recipient or planning
**Why**: Abstract thinking is still developing; choosing can feel overwhelming with too many options
**Solution**: Offer 2-3 specific recipient choices rather than open-ended question. Use visual reminders (pictures of family members, photo of teacher) to help child decide. Help brainstorm what recipient likes: "Remember when Grandpa showed us his favorite color? What was it?"

**Challenge**: Child loses focus after short period or doesn't want to finish
**Why**: Attention span varies; child may be tired, hungry, or overstimulated by materials and choices
**Solution**: Keep initial sessions short (15 minutes). Recognize that an incomplete gift is still an accomplishment. Offer to finish together or save to complete later. Accept simple, quick gifts as complete products: a decorated piece of paper is a finished gift.

**Challenge**: Child creates gift but then doesn't want to give it away
**Why**: Child becomes attached to creation or feels anxious about separation
**Solution**: Allow child to decide whether to give the gift or keep it. Offer to photograph it first so you have a memory. Create a duplicate gift the child can give while keeping one. Discuss feelings about giving: "It's normal to like what we made. But giving gifts makes people happy, and that feels good too."

**Challenge**: Glue makes crafting frustrating (too much/too little, doesn't stick)
**Why**: Glue application requires fine motor control and pressure regulation
**Solution**: Use glue dots or glue sticks instead of bottles for younger children. Pre-apply small amounts of glue and let child place decorations. Use double-sided tape as alternative. Accept tape-decorated gifts as equally valid.

### Tips for Success
- Keep first gifts very simple: one piece of paper + markers is a complete gift
- Focus on the relationship and feelings rather than gift appearance
- Photographs of handmade gifts allow children to preserve memory while gifting the item
- Create a special ritual around gift delivery: plan when/where it will be given, talk about how recipient will feel
- Model genuine gift-giving yourself so child sees the practice in action
- Don't redirect child's design choices - trust their creative decisions
- Have backup simple activities ready in case child loses interest in decorating

### What to Do With the Creation
- **Display**: Keep a photo gallery of gifts made, showing child's generosity over time
- **Give immediately**: If possible, have child deliver gift while still excited about creation
- **Mail it**: If recipient is distant, safely wrap gift for mailing - child helps prepare package
- **Save the memory**: Take photo before gifting, create a "gifts I've made" album (digital or physical)
- **Document growth**: Keep one gift per season to track evolving skills and interests
- **Preserve through photo**: If child made multiple gifts but didn't give all, photograph them and create a scrapbook
- **Honor the giving**: Whether gift is given or kept, celebrate child's generosity and thoughtfulness
