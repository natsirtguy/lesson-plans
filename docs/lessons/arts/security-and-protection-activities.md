# ARTS & CULTURE ACTIVITY: Security and Protection Activities

## Activity Summary

Security and protection activities help young children develop confidence, body awareness, and an understanding of personal boundaries through creative movement, storytelling, role-play, and empowering games. Children learn that they can express preferences, ask for help, and recognize trusted adults while engaging in joyful physical activities and imaginative play. This activity builds a foundation for safety and self-advocacy while emphasizing that caring adults work together to keep children safe.

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Gather in a circle and show a picture of a trusted adult: "This is [name], someone who keeps us safe. Who are the people who keep you safe?"
- Listen to children's answers warmly
- Introduce the concept: "Today we're learning about the people who protect and care for us, and how to stay safe together."
- Use empowering language: "You're going to learn that your body is yours, and that's important."

**Setting expectations**:
- "We're going to talk about and practice asking for help and saying what we like and don't like."
- "Everyone's voice matters. Everyone gets to say what they like."
- "We all work together to keep everyone safe and happy."

### Main Activity (15-18 minutes)

**Phase 1: Identifying Safe and Trusted Helpers** (4-5 minutes)
- Show picture cards of different people: parent, teacher, doctor, relative, friend
- Ask: "Who helps keep us safe?" and "Who do you trust?"
- Discuss different helpers in the child's life: "Who takes care of you? Who do you feel safe with?"
- Create a visual display: "These are our trusted helpers. They care about us."
- Affirm: "It's good to know and trust the people around us."

**Phase 2: Body Autonomy and Boundaries** (5-7 minutes)
- Use a doll or stuffed animal: "This is our friend. Nobody gets to touch our bodies in ways we don't like."
- Demonstrate appropriate touch: gentle hugs, high-fives, holding hands
- Use clear language: "We can say 'I like that' or 'I don't like that' with our bodies."
- Practice with children:
  - "Everyone show me a hug you like" (children decide how to demonstrate)
  - "Show me a way to say hello that you like"
  - "What kind of touch feels good?"
- Emphasize: "Your body is yours. You get to decide what happens to it."

**Phase 3: Practicing Asking for Help and Setting Boundaries** (remaining time)
- Use role-play with dolls or stuffed animals:
  - "What if someone wants to hug but you don't feel like hugging? You can say 'No, thank you' or 'Not now.'"
  - Model with doll: "Here's me saying 'I don't want to be picked up right now. I want to be put down.'"
- Have children practice: "Show me how you'd say you don't want something. Good! That's how you protect yourself."
- Practice getting help: "What if you don't understand something? You can ask for help. Show me how you'd ask an adult for help."
- Celebrate assertiveness: "That's perfect! You told me what you needed."

**Adult role**:
- Model confidence and clear communication
- Validate all feelings and preferences
- Never force physical affection from children
- Respect when children set boundaries
- Help children use words for their needs: "I see you pushing away. Say 'not now' or 'I want space.'"
- Emphasize that being protective of themselves is smart, not rude

### Wrap-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Gather together and affirm: "You learned something really important today. Your body is yours. You get to decide about it."
- Review the key trusted people: "And these trusted adults are here to help keep you safe."
- Celebrate confidence and boundaries: "You know how to say what you need. That makes you strong!"

**Transition to next activity**:
- Use the language: "Now we're going to [next activity], and you can tell me if you want to or don't want to do something."
- Keep the message alive in daily interactions: "Remember, you're in charge of your body."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Approach**:
- Focus primarily on the trusted adult relationship - they're too young for detailed discussions of boundaries
- Use very physical, concrete activities: show types of touch they like, practice saying "no" with simple demonstrations
- Don't introduce complex scenarios yet
- Use lots of repetition of the main idea: "Your body is yours"
- Let them see you respect boundaries with other children: "She said 'no,' so we stop. That's good."
- Model constantly in daily care: ask before picking up, ask before wiping face, "Do you want a hug?"
- Use dolls and stuffed animals more than direct conversation

**Duration**: 15-18 minutes (shorter for this age)

**Adult support**: Very active demonstration; you model respectful touch; children learn through observation

### 3-4+ years
**Extensions**:
- Introduce more complex discussions about "private parts" (basic, age-appropriate names)
- Ask children to think of trusted helpers and trusted situations
- Role-play more complex scenarios: "What if a stranger offers candy?" "What if someone touches you in a way you don't like?"
- Discuss feelings vocabulary: safe, uncomfortable, scared, happy, silly
- Introduce the concept of "body privacy" in basic terms
- Ask children to demonstrate and teach others: "Can you show your friend how we ask for help?"
- Discuss that secrets about touch are not okay: "We don't keep secrets about touch. We tell trusted adults."
- Expand trusted helper list to include teachers, coaches, relatives

**Duration**: 23-25 minutes (can handle more discussion and complexity)

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Trusted Helpers Portrait**
Create drawings or paste pictures of trusted adults in the child's life. Talk about what makes them trustworthy. Display prominently as a reminder.

**Variation 2: Safety and Feeling Walks**
Take a slow, thoughtful walk through familiar spaces. At each location, ask: "Do you feel safe here? Who helps keep us safe here?" Notice both the people and the features that help (railings, lights, etc.).

**Variation 3: Feelings and Body Stories**
Read books about feelings and bodies. Pause to discuss: "How does this character feel? What would help them feel safe?"

**Variation 4: Personal Space and Touch Games**
Play gentle games exploring personal space: standing close and far apart, different types of greetings (hug, high-five, wave, smile), asking before touching. Emphasize consent and choice.

**Variation 5: Helper Role-Play**
Act out scenarios where a child might need help: getting something from high up, opening something, understanding something confusing. Practice asking for and receiving help.

**Variation 6: Create a "Safe Place" Together**
Build a cozy fort or safe space where children feel secure. Talk about what makes it feel safe (soft things, quiet, with people they trust).

**Thematic variations**:
- Different environments (home, school, park, car)
- Different trusted adults (family, teachers, community helpers)
- Different feelings and safety (happy safe, sleepy safe, scared and need help, etc.)

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Protection of children is a value found in every human culture. Different cultures express protection and safety differently - from extended family care systems to communal child-rearing practices to protective ceremonies. The concept of teaching children about their own bodies and empowering them to seek help is increasingly recognized across cultures as important for child development. Security, protection, and the establishment of safe relationships form the foundation of healthy development and are taught through stories, rituals, and mentoring relationships in all societies.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Discuss how different families show care and protection in different ways
- Talk about different family structures and trusted adults (some children have multiple caregivers, some live with grandparents, etc.)
- Show that protection and safety are important in all cultures, though expressed differently
- Highlight different ways helpers show care (words, actions, presence)
- If possible, invite trusted community members to talk about their role in keeping children safe

**Books/Media**:
- "The Kissing Hand" by Audrey Penn - reassurance and comfort
- "I Like Myself!" by Karen Beaumont - body confidence
- "No Means No!" and other boundary-teaching books
- "A Child's Book About Safety" - teaching concepts simply
- "My Body Belongs to Me" - age-appropriate body autonomy teaching

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes shy, withdrawn, or doesn't want to participate in demonstrations
**Why**: Some children are more private about their bodies; they may feel embarrassed; they may have experienced a situation that makes them cautious
**Solution**: Never force participation. Let them watch and learn from observation. Praise any engagement: "You're listening carefully, and that's part of learning." This activity may need to be scaled way back or done one-on-one rather than in a group.

**Challenge**: Child uses the "your body is yours" message to resist necessary care (bathing, medical care, etc.)
**Solution**: Clarify the difference between choices and necessary care. "Your body is yours, AND I need to keep you healthy. So we're going to take a bath because it keeps you clean and healthy." Offer limited choices within what must happen: "Do you want to take a bath first or brush teeth first?"

**Challenge**: Adult feels uncomfortable with the topic or worried about saying the "wrong thing"
**Why**: Many adults didn't receive good body autonomy and safety teaching themselves
**Solution**: Keep language simple and factual. Use proper names for body parts. Remember that keeping children safe and teaching them to advocate for themselves is important. You don't have to be perfect - just present and caring.

**Challenge**: Child discloses that someone touched them in a way that made them uncomfortable
**Why**: This activity may prompt them to share because they now have language for the experience
**Solution**: Stay calm. Validate their feeling: "Thank you for telling me. Your feelings matter." Believe what they tell you. Get help from trusted professionals - contact a child protection hotline if you're concerned about abuse. Don't promise to keep it secret - you need to tell trusted adults who can help.

### Tips for Success

- **Respect all boundaries** - model what you teach; never force physical affection
- **Use body-positive language** - talk about bodies as healthy, capable, and worthy of respect
- **Teach proper anatomical names** - using real names normalizes body parts and makes it easier for children to communicate
- **Establish trusted relationships** - the most important security is knowing adults who listen and respond to needs
- **Practice regularly** - children need many reminders of these concepts; weave body autonomy language into daily care
- **Listen and respond** - when children express preferences or feelings, take them seriously; this teaches them their voice matters
- **Balance safety with trust** - help them know that they can both protect themselves AND trust caring adults
- **Don't make promises you can't keep** - avoid "I'll never let anything bad happen" because life includes some difficult experiences

### What to Do With the Creation

- **Create a trusted helpers list or picture** - display prominently as a resource and reminder
- **Document learning** - notice and celebrate when children set boundaries or ask for help: "You said 'not now' - that's perfect!"
- **Share with other caregivers** - ensure all trusted adults in the child's life are using consistent, empowering language
- **Make this ongoing** - these concepts need reinforcement throughout childhood
- **Revisit and build on** - return to this activity periodically with new scenarios or discussions appropriate to their growing understanding
- **Create family safety plan** - establish with the child who they can go to if they feel unsafe or unsure
