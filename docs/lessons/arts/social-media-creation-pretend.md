# ARTS & CULTURE ACTIVITY: Social Media Creation (Pretend)

## Activity Summary

In this imaginative activity, children explore the concept of sharing and creating content through pretend play, simulating social media experiences in an age-appropriate, screen-free way. Children use art materials, props, and storytelling to create "posts," take pretend photos, and share their creations with others, developing communication skills, creative expression, and an understanding of how people share experiences. This activity introduces digital literacy concepts while keeping children engaged in hands-on, creative play that emphasizes the joy of sharing and self-expression.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression/Pretend play/Social activity

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Mess Level**: Medium - art supplies, optional loose materials, potential for craft materials to scatter

**Best Environment**: Indoor at table or large open area with space for gallery setup

## Complete Activity Setup

### Materials Needed

**Essential materials**:
- Paper (standard, cardstock, or construction paper) - 5-10 sheets per child
- Markers, crayons, or colored pencils - variety of colors
- Child-safe scissors - 1-2 pairs
- Glue stick or tape - for assembly
- A toy camera, smartphone (turned off), tablet (turned off), or cardboard camera made from a box

**Cost estimate**: Free (using paper, markers, and common household items)

**Preparation time**: 10 minutes

### Step-by-Step Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Gather all materials and place in accessible containers
2. Set up a "creation station" where children can draw, cut, and assemble
3. Create a designated "gallery wall" or table where finished "posts" will be displayed
4. Prepare the toy/pretend camera and any props

**Environment setup**:
- Clear table or large floor space with enough room for multiple children to create simultaneously
- Cover table with paper or washable tablecloth to protect surface
- Arrange materials in clear containers within arm's reach
- Designate a "sharing circle" area with cushions or sitting space for viewing completed work
- Set up the gallery display area with tape or clips ready to hang/post creations

**Cleaning supplies ready**:
- Wet wipes or damp cloth for marker cleanup
- Paper towels for spills
- Trash bin for scraps

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Ask children: "Do you know what it means when grown-ups share pictures with their friends?" Let them share their ideas
- Show the toy/pretend camera and say: "Today, we're going to be artists and photographers! We're going to create our own special pictures and share them with our friends, just like people do on their phones"
- Demonstrate by creating a quick simple drawing or collage on a paper: "Look, I made a picture of my favorite toy. I'm going to share it with all of you!"

**Setting expectations**:
- "We're going to make beautiful pictures and creations that show what we like, what makes us happy, or what we're thinking about"
- "When we're done, we'll look at everyone's creations together and share them like real artists. There's no 'wrong' way to make your post - everyone's creation is special!"

### Main Activity (15-25 minutes)

**Phase 1: Exploration** (4-6 minutes)
Children explore materials and think about what they want to create.

- Invite children to browse the materials and choose what interests them
- Ask questions: "What do you want to show your friends today? What makes you happy? What's your favorite thing?"
- Encourage free drawing, scribbling, or immediate creation
- Observe what themes emerge - favorites (animals, family, colors, toys), feelings, or activities

**Phase 2: Guided Creation** (7-12 minutes)
Introduce techniques and the concept of creating a "post."

- Show how to arrange materials on their paper: "Your paper is like the screen on a phone where you share your picture"
- Demonstrate simple techniques: drawing, pasting stickers, using markers
- For more advanced children: explain that posts can tell a story - "My picture shows me playing with my dog" or be simple - "I like purple"
- Ask guiding questions: "What colors will you use? What's happening in your picture? Who would you like to show this to?"
- Help with cutting if needed, or offer pre-cut shapes as alternatives
- Support letter/word formation if child wants to add a caption or label

**Phase 3: Free Expression** (remaining time)
Children complete their creations at their own pace.

- Circulate and offer encouragement: "I love the colors you chose! Tell me about your picture"
- Ask open-ended questions about their work: "What's your favorite part? What does this mean to you?"
- Offer gentle suggestions if a child seems stuck: "You could add more to your picture, or you could start something new"
- Allow children to make multiple "posts" if they choose
- For children who finish early: offer options to add more details, help friends, or practice "photographing" their creations

**Adult role**:
- Facilitate and encourage - be a cheerful assistant rather than director
- Ask questions rather than directing what to create
- Help with technical skills (cutting, fine motor support) as needed
- Document children's explanations and thoughts about their work
- Model enthusiasm and genuine interest in their creations
- Step back and allow independent creative choice; avoid corrections or suggestions about what they "should" make

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Gather children in a sharing circle
- Invite each child to show their creation: "Who would like to share first?"
- For each "post," ask: "Tell us about your picture. What does it show?" or "Why did you like making this?"
- After sharing, tape or display all creations on the gallery wall or table
- Celebrate: "Everyone made something special! These are beautiful posts from amazing artists"

**Transition to cleanup**:
- Ask children to help tidy materials: "Let's put the markers back in the container together"
- Make cleanup collaborative and positive: "You're such good helpers!"
- Keep creations on display for several days so children can revisit them

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Approach**:
- Focus on the process of making marks and choosing colors rather than creating a "story"
- Keep materials simpler: crayons and paper primarily, maybe stickers
- Shorter explanations and demonstrations - show more, say less
- Adult provides more hands-on support with fine motor skills
- Celebrate simple scribbles and marks as valid "posts"

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Adult support**:
- Sit alongside the child and model creating
- Hand-over-hand guidance for cutting or fine motor tasks
- Frequent encouragement: "You're making beautiful marks!"
- Simple language: "You made purple lines. You like blue stickers."

### 3-4+ years
**Extensions**:
- Introduce narrative elements: "Your post can tell a story about something you did today or something you love"
- Offer writing/labeling: Help children add simple words, letters, or captions ("Happy," "I like dogs," "My family")
- More complex creative choices: combining multiple materials, making designs, arranging elements thoughtfully
- Introduce pretend "comments": After sharing, others can say what they like about the post - "I like your bright colors!" or "That's a funny hat!"
- Optional: Create a pretend "like" system - use stickers or drawing hearts on a separate paper to "like" each creation

**Duration**: They may engage for 30+ minutes and want to create multiple posts

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Photo Props Studio**
Set up a pretend photo studio where children dress up with props (hats, scarves, glasses), pose for the toy camera, and then draw or paint what they "looked like" in their photo. Creates a connection between real self-images and artistic representation.

**Variation 2: Story Series Posts**
Create a series of connected "posts" that tell a story across multiple drawings or papers: "First my character woke up, then... then... then." This introduces sequencing and narrative development.

**Variation 3: Collaborative Feed**
Create one large "wall" or "feed" where multiple children contribute to the same display, building a shared gallery. Older children can arrange the posts, create titles, or add borders to frame the collection.

**Thematic variations**:
- Seasonal posts: "What do you see in spring? In winter?"
- Holiday creations: "Create a post about your favorite holiday memory"
- Interest-based: "Make a post about animals," "Show us your favorite food," "Draw your family or friends"
- Emotion posts: "Make a post that shows how you feel today"
- Adventure series: Children create a sequence showing an imaginary adventure

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Social sharing has been a fundamental human activity across cultures for millennia - from cave paintings and tapestries to family photos and written letters. This activity helps children understand that sharing our creations, experiences, and thoughts with others is a natural, joyful human behavior. In modern times, social media represents how people share stories and connect. This pretend version allows young children to explore these concepts without screen exposure while emphasizing the values of self-expression, community, and meaningful connection.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Show examples of art and creative expression from different cultures - Aboriginal dot paintings, African masks, Japanese printmaking, Mexican folk art
- Discuss how people around the world share their creations and stories
- Encourage children to draw things important to their own family or culture
- Include diverse images in magazine cutouts or sticker collections
- Celebrate that every person's "post" is unique and valuable, reflecting their own perspective

**Books/Media**:
- "The Day the Crayons Quit" by Drew Daywalt - about creative expression and perspective
- "Creation Stories from Around the World" - shows how different cultures value making and sharing

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is hesitant or anxious about sharing their work
**Why**: Young children can feel vulnerable about their creations or worry they're "not good enough"
**Solution**: Normalize all attempts - "There's no right or wrong way to make art. Your picture is special because you made it." Don't force sharing; let them decide. Start with small group shares, then one-on-one if needed. Ask what they'd like others to know about their work rather than asking "What is it?"

**Challenge**: One child dominates materials or wants to create continuously while others are ready to move on
**Why**: Some children have strong creative drive or difficulty with transitions
**Solution**: Set clear time parameters before starting: "We're going to create for 20 minutes, then we'll share." Use a visual timer. Offer choices at transition: "You can finish this one more post or help me with the gallery." Ensure enough materials for parallel play.

**Challenge**: Child compares their work negatively to others' creations
**Why**: Young children are developing self-awareness and can be sensitive to perceived differences in ability
**Solution**: Emphasize different, not better: "Look, everyone chose different colors and shapes. That's what makes each post special." Highlight specific strengths in each child's work: "You used so many colors!" "Your shapes are interesting." Avoid ranking or comparative praise.

**Challenge**: Mess escalates with multiple children, materials get scattered
**Why**: Young children are still developing spatial awareness and impulse control in group settings
**Solution**: Contain materials in bins or boxes. Use individual trays or sections of table for each child. Set clear expectations: "Markers stay on the table." Have cleanup supplies immediately accessible. Reframe spills as learning: "Oops, we need to clean that up together."

### Tips for Success
- **Honor the process, not the product** - The goal is creative expression and sharing, not perfect artworks. Children thrive when the focus is on their joy and effort, not aesthetic outcome
- **Document children's words** - Write down what children say about their creations. These stories are as valuable as the artwork itself and can be shared with families
- **Create a display that stays up** - Children benefit from seeing their work valued in a prominent place for several days or longer. This reinforces that their expression matters
- **Vary the "audience"** - Sometimes share with just one other person, sometimes in a small group, sometimes with stuffed animals or imaginary friends. This reduces pressure while practicing the social skill of sharing

### What to Do With the Creation
- **Display in prominent location** - Tape on walls, refrigerator, bulletin board, or gallery wall at child's eye level. Keep displayed for 3-7 days
- **Create a portfolio** - Keep creations in a folder or box for each child throughout the month or year to see growth over time
- **Share with family** - Send photos home or send the original artwork with a note about what the child shared
- **Make a book** - Compile multiple "posts" from one child or from the whole group into a bound book titled "Our Posts" or "Our Gallery"
- **When to let go** - After the display period, ask children if they want to keep it or if they're ready to recycle it. Some children prefer to move on, others want to keep special creations
- **Photography** - Take photos of displays and creations for digital documentation if creating a digital portfolio
