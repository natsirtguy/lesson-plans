# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Acting and Character Play

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Acting and character play allows young children to step into different roles and explore the world through imaginative play, developing empathy, language skills, and creative expression. Through simple character play—pretending to be animals, family members, or favorite characters—children experiment with different ways of moving, speaking, and interacting. This foundational dramatic activity builds confidence, emotional understanding, and social skills while having tremendous fun.

## Vocabulary

**Character**: A person, animal, or creature that you imagine and pretend to be, using your body, voice, and actions to show how they move and speak.

**Expression**: Showing your feelings, thoughts, and ideas through the way you move your body, the sounds you make with your voice, and the faces you make.

**Improvise**: To make up movements, sounds, and ideas on the spot without planning them ahead of time—creating as you play.

**Performance**: Doing something in a special way for others to watch, like acting out a scene or showing how a character moves and behaves.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children choose a character to become, then explore how that character moves, speaks, and acts. Through guided exploration and free play, they develop creative expression, physical awareness, and social understanding. You model characters, ask questions, and celebrate their interpretations without judgment.

**Activity Type**: Performing arts/Dramatic expression/Creative play

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Open floor or outdoor space (at least 10x10 feet)
- Simple scarves, blankets, or fabric pieces (2-3 pieces, child-sized)
- Simple props from home (wooden spoon, stuffed animal, or toy)
- Your own expressive voice and movement

**Optional**:
- Simple costume pieces (oversized adult clothing, hats, masks)
- Recorded music or musical instrument (drum, xylophone, bells)
- Picture cards of animals or characters for inspiration
- Simple backdrop made from blanket or sheet
- Props like child-safe kitchen items, toy phone, or paintbrush

**Cost**: Free (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Clear a large space free of obstacles and breakable items
2. Remove any small choking hazards from the play area
3. Gather props and costume pieces you'll use; ensure adequate space for running, spinning, and dramatic movements (minimum 10x10 feet)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Start with enthusiasm and energy: "Today we're going to play some fun pretending games!" Demonstrate a simple character yourself—move like a cat, make the sound, show what you're doing. Show interest in what the child might like to be: "Who would you like to be today? An animal? Someone in our family?" Make it feel like a fun game, not a performance. Say: "We can move around however we want, make sounds, and pretend to do things that character does. There's no right way to do this—everyone can be a character in their own way."

2. **Exploration** (5-10 min):
   Ask: "What animal do you want to be?" or "Who do you want to pretend to be?" If the child needs ideas, offer simple choices: "Do you want to be a dog, a cat, a bird, or a dinosaur?" Invite them to show you with their body and voice: "Show me how a [character] moves." Respond with genuine interest: "Oh! You're moving so fast like that! What sound does a [character] make?" Model the character alongside them—move like the animal together, make sounds together. Ask questions to deepen the play: "What does a dog eat? Can you pretend to eat? What else does a dog do?" Add simple scenarios: "The cat is sleepy—can you show me how the cat sleeps? Now the cat sees a mouse!" Introduce simple props if desired: "Here's a stick—your dog can fetch this stick."

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Step back and let the child lead their own play with your encouragement. Provide gentle prompts only if energy is flagging: "What happens next to your character?" Join in occasionally: "Can I be a friend to your character? I could be another dog!" Allow the play to evolve naturally—characters may change, scenarios may shift. Celebrate effort and creativity: "You're so creative with how your character moves!" Narrate what you see: "You're hopping like a bunny—hop, hop, hop!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Signal ending gently: "We're going to be regular [child's name] again in a moment." Help transition: "Let's take a big stretch and step out of our character." Reflect on the experience: "What was your favorite character you were today?" Celebrate: "You were so creative being that [character]!" Gather props together while chatting about the experience. Child can help put costume pieces back in the basket.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep scenarios very simple (one or two actions: "the dog runs, the dog sleeps"). Stick with familiar animals or family members (dog, cat, mama, daddy). Make it very physical and movement-based rather than dialogue-heavy. Use lots of sound effects yourself to model how characters can sound. Expect very short attention to individual characters (may change every 1-2 minutes). Allow much more observation and imitation rather than demanding performance. Duration: 10-15 minutes with frequent breaks and character changes. You'll need a high level of participation and modeling—you are the primary actor demonstrating characters.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce more complex characters (fairy tale characters, occupations, superheroes). Build short, simple storylines: "You're going to the grocery store. What will you buy?" Encourage more dialogue: "What does your character say? Can you talk like them?" Add multiple characters: "I'll be a cat, you be a mouse. Now we play together." Introduce simple props that inspire stories: "You're a doctor—here's a stethoscope made from rope." Encourage sustained play in one character for longer periods (5-10 minutes). Add costume elements (hat, scarf) to deepen engagement. Duration: 20-30 minutes; older children may return to the same character repeatedly.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Animal Families**:
Set up a simple scenario where characters are family members: "You're the mama bear, I'm the baby bear. Where are we going today?" Explore different animal families and their behaviors.

**Variation 2 - Occupation Play**:
Focus on characters with roles: "You're the teacher, I'm a student. What are we learning about?" or "You're the chef cooking dinner." Explore familiar occupations and work roles.

**Repeat play**:
Keep props and simple costume pieces in an accessible basket for spontaneous character play throughout the week. Introduce seasonal themes (pumpkin in fall, snowman in winter, garden creatures in spring), holiday characters (Santa, reindeer, pumpkins, turkeys), vehicles and drivers (train conductor, taxi driver, astronaut), and everyday scenarios (shopper at store, visitor at home, friend at playground).

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is shy or refuses to participate in character play

**Solution**: Never force participation. Let the child watch you be a character first. Say: "I'm going to be a silly kitty cat" and demonstrate for 2-3 minutes. Then say: "Do you want to try?" If no, that's okay—continue modeling. Many children will eventually join after observing. You can also try starting with props: "This scarf can be a tail—do you want to wear it?" Sometimes children join easier if they're part of creating the costume.

**Challenge**: Child wants to stay in character or keeps asking "Can I be the dinosaur again?" repeatedly

**Solution**: This is wonderful! Let them repeat. Repetition builds confidence and allows them to explore the character more deeply. You can gently introduce variations: "The dinosaur is hungry now—what will the dinosaur eat?" But if they want to be the dinosaur for the entire session, that's perfect practice.

**Challenge**: Child's acting is extremely chaotic—running wild, not really staying in character

**Solution**: This is age-appropriate for younger children (especially 2-3 years) who may use character play as an excuse for energetic running. Provide physical boundaries: "Our dinosaur plays in this area here" (define the space). Give the character actions to do: "The dinosaur stomps to the cave and sleeps" (directed movement). If it becomes unsafe, redirect: "Our dinosaur needs to walk, not run, so nobody gets hurt."

**Challenge**: Child uses character play to act out aggressive behaviors (hitting, pushing)

**Solution**: Gently redirect: "The dinosaur can roar loudly, but we don't hit with our dinosaur. The dinosaur can stomp (show stomping) instead." Reframe aggressive ideas into acceptable character actions: "Your superhero is strong! Let's show that strength by doing big jumps instead."

### Follow-Up Activities

1. Take a photo or video of your child in character (if they're comfortable) to remember the fun and revisit favorite characters in future play sessions
2. Build on character play by using picture books featuring diverse characters—read the story, then act it out together
3. Keep a basket of simple props and costume pieces accessible throughout the week for spontaneous dramatic play and character exploration
