# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Basic Web Design Concepts

## 🎯 Activity Summary

In this unplugged, hands-on activity, children become web designers and architects without ever touching a computer. They'll create paper websites, design clickable buttons, draw layouts, and build web pages using blocks and craft materials, learning real design thinking concepts like navigation, organization, visual hierarchy, and how information is structured.

## Vocabulary

**Design**: The thoughtful plan for how something looks and works, including the colors, shapes, and arrangement of different parts. When you arrange your toys in a specific way or choose colors for your drawing, you are making a design.

**Navigation**: The buttons and paths that help people find their way around a website or move through information. When you tap buttons on your parent's phone to explore different screens, you are using navigation.

**Layout**: The organized arrangement of different elements—where the pictures go, where the buttons are placed, and where the text appears. A grocery store has a layout with different sections for produce, dairy, and bread so shoppers know where to find things.

**Visual Hierarchy**: The way designers make the most important information stand out by making it bigger, brighter, or placing it where people look first. On a favorite poster or book cover, the biggest picture or title is usually the most important thing the designer wants you to notice.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore design thinking by creating paper websites. They'll plan layouts, draw or cut out buttons, organize visual elements, and think about how people navigate and use information—all without screens. This hands-on exploration teaches that humans intentionally organize and design spaces so others can understand and use them.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression, Design thinking, Role-playing, Exploration

**Duration**: 20-35 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Large sheets of paper (white poster board, kraft paper, or 11x14" paper)—2-3 sheets per child
- Colored markers, crayons, or colored pencils
- Safety scissors (child-safe)
- Tape (masking tape or painter's tape)
- Index cards or small paper squares for buttons

**Optional**:
- Pre-printed wireframe templates (simple box outlines showing webpage layout)
- Stickers or stamps for decoration
- Yarn or string to show connections between pages
- Small brads or paper fasteners to make moveable buttons
- Magazine cutouts for collage-style design
- Blocks (wooden, plastic, or foam) for layout exploration

**Cost**: Free to $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Lay out all materials on a table within reach of children
2. Protect the work surface with a large paper or plastic tablecloth if needed
3. Have scissors within safe reach with supervision ready
4. Arrange materials in a central location so children can self-select

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Start by asking: "Have you ever seen a website? What do you remember about it?" Listen to their descriptions of colors, pictures, buttons, and words. Explain: "Today, we're going to become web designers and create our own websites—but on paper instead of a computer. We get to decide where everything goes, what colors to use, and what buttons people will click."

2. **Exploration** (5-10 min):
   Ask open-ended questions: "What kind of website do you want to make? A website about animals? Your favorite foods? A game?" Show visual examples if helpful. Children brainstorm their website topic and what they want it to feature. Encourage: "Your website can be about anything you like!"

3. **Discovery** (5-10 min):
   Children design their layout on paper and add interactive buttons. Show simple wireframe thinking: "Most websites have a big heading here [point to top], a picture or welcome message in the middle, and buttons below." Children decide where things go, add colors and labels, and create 2-4 buttons from index cards. Ask: "What's the most important thing on your website? Where should it go? What buttons do you want? What colors look nice?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Gather children and invite them to share their websites, explaining what they created and why they organized it that way. Affirm: "You're thinking like real web designers! You organized everything so it makes sense." Ask: "What was fun about designing your website? What would you change if you made another one?" Make cleanup part of learning by organizing materials by type.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on free drawing and exploration of shapes rather than structured websites. Provide pre-drawn boxes on paper so children color and fill in rather than creating structure. Use mostly markers and crayons (you cut materials). Heavy emphasis on sensory experience and color choice. Work alongside the child collaboratively rather than independent design. Duration: 15-20 minutes.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce vocabulary: "header," "navigation," "content," "footer." Challenge: "How many buttons should your website have? What should each one do?" Create multiple pages connected by string links. Add written labels or signs. Use blocks to build 3D website structures. Introduce user-centered thinking: "Design a website for someone else—what would they want to see? Where should buttons be so people can find them easily?" Duration: 30-40 minutes or longer if interested.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Website for Someone Else**
Design a website for a specific person or character—maybe a website for their teddy bear, a cafe, or a library. Who would visit? What would they want to find? This builds empathy and user-centered thinking.

**Variation 2: Multi-Page Website**
Create 2-3 connected pages. Use yarn or string to show how clicking a button takes you from one page to another. Children can walk along the "links" to demonstrate how the website works, teaching navigation and interconnection.

**Repeat play**: Pick a familiar place (favorite restaurant, park, store) and design what THEIR website should look like. What pictures would they show? What buttons would people need? Apply design thinking to the real world.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child has no idea what kind of website to design or feels overwhelmed.
**Solution**: Offer specific ideas to spark creativity: "You could make a website about dogs, dinosaurs, or your favorite food. What do you like?" Start with their interests. Role-play helps: "I'm visiting your website—what will I see first?"

**Challenge**: Child struggles with scissors or fine motor control.
**Solution**: You cut the buttons and paper pieces ahead of time. Child decorates and places them. For 3-4 year olds, guide hand-over-hand if needed. Consider pre-cut materials as a modification.

**Challenge**: Child tears paper or gets frustrated with the layout.
**Solution**: Have extra paper available so starting fresh is okay. Tape can fix tears—make it part of the process. Keep it playful: "Oops, let's tape that!"

**Challenge**: Child wants to use screens or a real computer instead.
**Solution**: Frame this as special: "Today, we're designers BEFORE computers. Real designers sketch on paper first, then use computers. You're doing what real designers do!" Make it feel valuable—hands-on thinking and creativity are foundational.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. Display the website on a wall or bulletin board to celebrate their work, or photograph it before it gets damaged
2. Create a "gallery opening" where family members visit all the websites and "click" the buttons together
3. Notice how designed spaces are organized (library, zoo, park, grocery store) and talk about how they work like websites with areas for different things and signs to help you navigate
