# Board Games and Strategy Play

## Activity Summary

Through simple board games, children develop turn-taking skills, practice waiting patiently, and begin to think ahead about their moves. This activity introduces strategic thinking in a playful way, building foundational skills for planning, decision-making, and social cooperation.

## Vocabulary

**Strategy**: A plan or approach you decide on ahead of time to reach a goal. When you're playing a game, your strategy might be deciding where to move your piece to get closer to winning.

**Turn-taking**: The practice of taking turns one at a time so everyone gets a chance to play. You take your turn, then the next person takes theirs—this helps games be fair and fun for everyone.

**Anticipate**: To think about what might happen next before it actually happens. When you anticipate in a game, you're thinking "If I move here, then what will happen?"

**Cooperative**: Working together with others toward a shared goal, even when you might not all win. Some games ask players to work as a team instead of competing against each other.

Moving pieces in our way,
Roll the dice and count them true,
Choose your moves, there's much to do,
Think ahead now, plan our way,
Games bring joy to every day.

Take your turn and have your say,
Wait your turn, let others play,
Listen well to every rule,
Winning's fun, but teamwork's cool,
Celebrate with friends so dear,
Playing games brings happy cheer.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will play a simplified board game that introduces turn-taking, following simple rules, and making basic strategic choices. This hands-on experience teaches patience, planning, and social skills while building confidence in game play and decision-making.

**Activity Type**: Interactive game play and turn-taking practice

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- A simple board game designed for ages 2+ (Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, Ludo Jr., or homemade board)
- Game pieces (child-safe tokens, buttons, or plastic counters)
- Large foam or plastic die (at least 2 inches)
- A flat surface to play on (table or floor)

**Optional**:
- Reward stickers or small celebration items for completed turns
- Picture cards showing game rules (helps with visual learning)
- Simplified rule cards with just the essential instructions

**Cost**: Free (if using existing games) to $10-15 (for new age-appropriate games)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose a simple game with clear, easy-to-follow rules and large game pieces
2. Set up the game board on a flat surface at child's eye level
3. Gather all game pieces and ensure they're clean and safe to handle

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Begin by gathering everyone around the game. Say: "Today we're going to play a special game together! In this game, we take turns. That means each person gets to take one turn, and then it's the next person's turn. We'll be moving our pieces around the board and seeing who reaches the end first!" Show the game pieces and let each child pick the color or piece they want to use.

2. **Learning the Basics** (3-5 min):
   Explain the game step-by-step. For simple games like Candy Land or Chutes and Ladders, say: "You roll the die (or pick a card), and that tells you how many spaces to move. Then you move your piece forward. If you land on a ladder, you climb up—that gets you closer to the end! If you land on a slide, you go back down. That's okay! Everyone takes turns doing this." Play through one full round with narration so children understand what happens.

3. **Beginning Play** (8-10 min):
   Start playing the game. Use these language prompts as you play:
   - "It's Sarah's turn now. Sarah, you roll the die! How many did you get? Let's count: 1, 2, 3—three spaces! Great job!"
   - "Now we wait for Emma's turn. We're being patient and watching her play."
   - "Oh, you landed on a ladder! That means you get to climb up. Nice move!"
   - "Keep going! There are lots more spaces to cover."

4. **Noticing Choices** (3 min during play):
   As you play, point out simple strategic elements: "You're getting close to the top! If you move carefully, you might reach it on your next turn!" This introduces the idea that moves matter and have consequences.

5. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   When someone reaches the end, celebrate with enthusiasm: "You made it all the way to the finish! Wonderful!" If multiple children are playing, let everyone finish. You might say: "Look at how far you all came! You all worked hard, took turns, and had fun together. That's what makes games special!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use the simplest available games with minimal rules: Candy Land, simple dice-and-move games, or homemade games where children just move a piece forward by rolling. Let them roll the die with your help and move their piece. Don't worry about winning—focus entirely on the experience of taking turns, rolling, and moving. It's okay if they don't finish the game. Celebrate each successful turn: "You rolled! You moved forward! Great job waiting your turn!"

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce games with slightly more strategy, such as Chutes and Ladders, simple version of Ludo, or matching games. Ask children to predict what will happen: "Where do you think you'll land if you roll a 3?" Let them choose between two moves: "Should you move your piece here or here?" Introduce the concept of "strategy" by talking about which move might be better. Keep track of progress together on the board.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Create Your Own Game**: Use a paper plate or cardboard as a game board. Draw spaces in a spiral with markers. Let children help decorate the board with stickers or drawings. Use a simple die to play. This teaches that games are something they can design and create.

**Variation 2 - Turn-Taking Practice Game**: Play a non-competitive turn-taking game where the goal is just participation. Example: Sit in a circle and pass a ball while singing. When the music stops, whoever holds the ball does a simple action (jump, spin, smile). This pure turn-taking practice removes competition and emphasizes fairness.

**Repeat Play**: Rotate through different games each week. Each time, children become more familiar with rules, faster at decision-making, and more patient with waiting. Notice and celebrate their growth: "Last time you had trouble waiting. Now you're waiting so patiently for your turn!"

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: A child gets upset about losing or doesn't want to wait for their turn.
**Solution**: Remember that turn-taking and losing are genuinely difficult for children under 4. Don't emphasize winning. Instead, celebrate the experience: "You moved your piece so far!" or "You waited so nicely for Sarah's turn—that was patience!" Consider playing cooperative games where everyone is on the same team against a challenge. Losing doesn't feel bad when the whole group "lost together" trying something hard.

**Challenge**: A child doesn't understand the rules or keeps breaking them.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal. Simplify the rules even more. Focus on just the basics: "Roll, count, move forward." You can learn other rules later. It's better to play a super-simple game correctly than a complex game with constant corrections. Use visual aids—draw or show pictures of the rules.

**Challenge**: The game is too long or children lose interest.
**Solution**: Stop playing before interest runs out. It's perfectly fine to play for 10 minutes and then do something else. You want children to think "Games are fun!" not "Games are boring and endless." You can always return to the game another day. Short, fun game sessions are better than forced, long ones.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Quick Turn-Taking Practice**: Throughout the day, use turn-taking in other contexts. When cooking, take turns stirring. When reading, take turns turning pages. This reinforces the skills from game play in daily life.

2. **Strategy Moments in Daily Life**: Point out simple strategy in real situations: "You're choosing the red cup instead of the blue one. That's a choice you're making!" This helps children see strategy as a normal part of decision-making.

3. **Game Design**: Let children create their own very simple games. Draw a path with spaces. Add pictures or stickers in some spaces. Play with a big die. Creating games deepens their understanding of how games work.
