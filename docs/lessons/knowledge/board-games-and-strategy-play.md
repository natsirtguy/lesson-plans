# Board Games and Strategy Play

## Activity Summary

Through simple board games, children develop turn-taking skills, practice waiting patiently, and begin to think ahead about their moves. This activity introduces strategic thinking in a playful way, building foundational skills for planning, decision-making, and social cooperation.

## Vocabulary

**Strategy**: A plan or approach you decide on ahead of time to reach a goal. Strategy only applies in games where your *choices actually matter* — if the outcome is entirely random, there's no strategy to use.

**Probability**: The mathematical chance of something happening. When you roll a 6-sided die, each number has a 1-in-6 probability of coming up — that's about 17% for any single number. Probability is why dice games feel unpredictable.

**Game theory**: A branch of mathematics and economics that studies how people make decisions when the outcome depends on other players' choices. Game theory is used by economists, military strategists, and biologists — not just game players.

**Turn-taking**: The practice of taking turns one at a time so everyone gets a chance to play. You take your turn, then the next person takes theirs—this helps games be fair and fun for everyone.

**Cooperative**: Working together with others toward a shared goal rather than competing. Cooperative games have been proven to develop stronger prosocial behavior than purely competitive ones, because success requires genuine collaboration.

**Decision tree**: A way of mapping out all the choices you could make and what might happen after each one. Chess players think several moves ahead using mental decision trees — "if I move here, they might move there, so then I could…"

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Cheerful and engaging

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Playing games we use strategy
Taking turns with friends
Anticipate what happens next
Cooperative play begins
With a roll roll here and a move move there
Here a turn, there a turn, everywhere we share

*Verse 2*
Board games teach us how to wait
Following the rules
Turn-taking helps us all play fair
Learning patience tools
With a think think here and a plan plan there
Here a game, there a game, playing everywhere

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Pretend to roll dice with enthusiastic rolling motions
2. Point to yourself then to a friend to show turn-taking
3. Tap your temple with one finger to show strategic thinking and planning ahead

## Key Concepts

**Chance vs. strategy — a critical distinction.** Some games are entirely luck-based: Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders are pure chance games — the outcome is determined entirely by dice or card draws, and no decision you make affects whether you win. This makes them excellent for *turn-taking practice*, but there is literally no strategy involved. Strategy games require decisions that matter: Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Connect Four, and Memory all require thinking ahead.

**Board games are ancient.** Humans have played board games for at least 5,000 years. Senet — found in Egyptian tombs from 3100 BCE — is the oldest known board game. Mancala boards carved into rock surfaces are found across Africa and may be even older. The Royal Game of Ur (c. 2600 BCE) was found in a Mesopotamian tomb. Chess originated in India around the 6th century CE and spread westward through Persia and the Islamic world. Go (围棋, *wéiqí*) is over 2,500 years old and is still played competitively today with dedicated professionals.

**Probability and dice.** A standard 6-sided die gives each number equal probability — 1/6 ≈ 17%. Importantly, each roll is *independent* — the die has no memory of past rolls. If you've rolled six 1s in a row, the probability of rolling another 1 is still exactly 1/6. This counterintuitive fact (called the "gambler's fallacy") confuses even adults.

**Game theory emerged from mathematics.** Mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern published the foundational theory of games in 1944. Game theory now underlies economics, evolutionary biology, political science, and even animal behavior research — animals competing for food or mates are essentially playing "games" with strategies that evolved over millions of years.

**What strategy games build.** Games requiring planning ahead specifically exercise *working memory* (holding the board state in mind), *inhibitory control* (resisting an impulsive move in favor of a better one), and *cognitive flexibility* (adjusting strategy when conditions change). These are the same executive function skills measured by researchers studying school readiness.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children play both chance-based and simple strategy games, learning to distinguish between them. They experience turn-taking, practice probability reasoning ("how likely is it I'll roll a 6?"), and begin thinking ahead using simple decision trees. Caregivers name the distinction clearly: "This game is about luck — Candy Land doesn't have strategy. Let's also try a game where your choices matter."

**Activity Type**: Interactive game play and turn-taking practice

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- A simple board game designed for ages 2+ (Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, Ludo Jr., or homemade board)
- Game pieces (child-safe tokens, buttons, or plastic counters)
- Large foam or plastic die (at least 2 inches)
- A flat surface to play on (table or floor)

**Optional**:
- Reward stickers or small celebration items for completed turns
- Picture cards showing game rules (helps with visual learning)
- Simplified rule cards with just the essential instructions

**Cost**: Free (if using existing games) to $10-15 (for new age-appropriate games)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose a simple game with clear, easy-to-follow rules and large game pieces
2. Set up the game board on a flat surface at child's eye level
3. Gather all game pieces and ensure they're clean and safe to handle

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Begin by gathering everyone around the game. Introduce the big idea: "There are two kinds of games in the world. Games of *chance*, where the dice or cards decide everything — like Candy Land. And games of *strategy*, where what you *decide* changes who wins — like Tic-Tac-Toe. Today we'll play both kinds." Show the game pieces and let each child pick the color or piece they want to use. Roll a die together and talk about probability: "There are six sides. Each one has the same chance of coming up — that's 1 out of 6."

2. **Learning the Basics** (3-5 min):
   Explain the game step-by-step. For simple games like Candy Land or Chutes and Ladders, say: "You roll the die (or pick a card), and that tells you how many spaces to move. Then you move your piece forward. If you land on a ladder, you climb up—that gets you closer to the end! If you land on a slide, you go back down. That's okay! Everyone takes turns doing this." Play through one full round with narration so children understand what happens.

3. **Beginning Play** (8-10 min):
   Start playing the game. Use these language prompts as you play:
   - "It's Sarah's turn now. Sarah, you roll the die! How many did you get? Let's count: 1, 2, 3—three spaces! Great job!"
   - "Now we wait for Emma's turn. We're being patient and watching her play."
   - "Oh, you landed on a ladder! That means you get to climb up. Nice move!"
   - "Keep going! There are lots more spaces to cover."

4. **Noticing Choices** (3 min during play):
   After the chance game, transition to a simple strategy game (Tic-Tac-Toe, or a homemade connect-the-dots grid). Point out the difference: "Now *you* get to decide where to put your mark. Which spot is best? What would happen if I went here?" Introduce decision tree thinking: "If you put yours here, I might go there — so what then?" This is what chess players call "thinking ahead."

5. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   When someone reaches the end, celebrate with enthusiasm: "You made it all the way to the finish! Wonderful!" If multiple children are playing, let everyone finish. You might say: "Look at how far you all came! You all worked hard, took turns, and had fun together. That's what makes games special!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use the simplest available games with minimal rules: Candy Land, simple dice-and-move games, or homemade games where children just move a piece forward by rolling. Let them roll the die with your help and move their piece. Don't worry about winning—focus entirely on the experience of taking turns, rolling, and moving. It's okay if they don't finish the game. Celebrate each successful turn: "You rolled! You moved forward! Great job waiting your turn!"

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce games with slightly more strategy, such as Chutes and Ladders, simple version of Ludo, or matching games. Ask children to predict what will happen: "Where do you think you'll land if you roll a 3?" Let them choose between two moves: "Should you move your piece here or here?" Introduce the concept of "strategy" by talking about which move might be better. Keep track of progress together on the board.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Create Your Own Game**: Use a paper plate or cardboard as a game board. Draw spaces in a spiral with markers. Let children help decorate the board with stickers or drawings. Use a simple die to play. This teaches that games are something they can design and create.

**Variation 2 - Turn-Taking Practice Game**: Play a non-competitive turn-taking game where the goal is just participation. Example: Sit in a circle and pass a ball while singing. When the music stops, whoever holds the ball does a simple action (jump, spin, smile). This pure turn-taking practice removes competition and emphasizes fairness.

**Repeat Play**: Rotate through different games each week. Each time, children become more familiar with rules, faster at decision-making, and more patient with waiting. Notice and celebrate their growth: "Last time you had trouble waiting. Now you're waiting so patiently for your turn!"

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: A child gets upset about losing or doesn't want to wait for their turn.
**Solution**: Remember that turn-taking and losing are genuinely difficult for children under 4. Don't emphasize winning. Instead, celebrate the experience: "You moved your piece so far!" or "You waited so nicely for Sarah's turn—that was patience!" Consider playing cooperative games where everyone is on the same team against a challenge. Losing doesn't feel bad when the whole group "lost together" trying something hard.

**Challenge**: A child doesn't understand the rules or keeps breaking them.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal. Simplify the rules even more. Focus on just the basics: "Roll, count, move forward." You can learn other rules later. It's better to play a super-simple game correctly than a complex game with constant corrections. Use visual aids—draw or show pictures of the rules.

**Challenge**: The game is too long or children lose interest.
**Solution**: Stop playing before interest runs out. It's perfectly fine to play for 10 minutes and then do something else. You want children to think "Games are fun!" not "Games are boring and endless." You can always return to the game another day. Short, fun game sessions are better than forced, long ones.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Quick Turn-Taking Practice**: Throughout the day, use turn-taking in other contexts. When cooking, take turns stirring. When reading, take turns turning pages. This reinforces the skills from game play in daily life.

2. **Strategy Moments in Daily Life**: Point out simple strategy in real situations: "You're choosing the red cup instead of the blue one. That's a choice you're making!" This helps children see strategy as a normal part of decision-making.

3. **Game Design**: Let children create their own very simple games. Draw a path with spaces. Add pictures or stickers in some spaces. Play with a big die. Creating games deepens their understanding of how games work.
