# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Broadcasting and Announcement Games

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Children explore the power of their voice and words by playing broadcaster games where they make pretend announcements, deliver news reports, or share messages with an audience. Through practicing clear speaking, projecting their voice, and addressing others, children develop confidence in communication, learn to speak intentionally, and discover how public speakers share information with groups of people.

## Vocabulary

**Broadcaster**: Someone who uses their voice and words to share information with many people at one time, like a news reporter or someone making an announcement.

**Announcement**: A message or piece of news that is said aloud so that other people can hear it and understand important information.

**Audience**: A group of people who listen to someone speaking or watch someone performing, giving them their full attention.

**Project (your voice)**: To speak loud and clear enough that people far away can hear you well, using your voice like a beam that carries far.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

This activity invites children to use their growing speaking skills in playful, powerful ways by creating their own broadcasts and announcements. Children become broadcasters—news anchors, weather reporters, sports commentators, or special event announcers—practicing clear speech, confident delivery, and the art of addressing an audience. Through this dramatic play, children discover that their voice matters and can communicate information to others.

**Activity Type**: Communication/Performing Arts/Dramatic Play

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Your voice and enthusiasm
- A designated "broadcasting" area (corner, table, or marked space)
- Optional pretend microphone (toy, real, or pretend using a hairbrush, wooden spoon, or paper towel tube)

**Optional**:
- Microphone stand or simple DIY stand
- Props (weather map, clipboard, notepad)
- Toy audience (stuffed animals, dolls)
- Recording device (phone or tablet)
- Simple backdrop or poster board
- Different hats or costumes for different roles
- Bell or sound effect device
- Simple prompt cards with ideas

**Cost**: Free to $5 (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Arrange a designated broadcasting area or "station" where the child can stand and be heard clearly
2. Gather optional props and set up toy audience if using them
3. Decide on types of announcements (news, weather, sports, silly announcements, special events)
4. Test the space to ensure child's voice carries well
5. Prepare simple prompt cards if desired (optional)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Build excitement and explain the role. Say: "Today you get to be a broadcaster! That's someone who makes announcements for people to hear." Demonstrate with an enthusiastic sample announcement: "Attention everyone! It's snack time! Come to the kitchen!" Show them the broadcasting station and explain that they can announce anything they think of.

2. **Exploration** (5-10 min):
   Model several different broadcasting styles—a news reporter, weather person, sports commentator, or silly announcer. Use different voices and energy. Invite the child to repeat an announcement after you or help you make one together. Then invite the child to step up to the microphone and share their own announcements. Ask: "What would you like to announce?" Offer prompts if needed: "You could announce snack time, the weather, or something silly!"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Have the toy audience and yourself listen with full attention and respond: "Thank you for that announcement!" or "Great job!" Ask follow-up questions: "Tell us more!" or "What's happening next?" If the child is comfortable, record their announcements. Gently coach on clarity by asking: "Can you say that louder so everyone can hear?" rather than correcting.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Thank the child for their announcements and highlight a favorite moment: "I really liked your weather announcement!" Ask what they enjoyed about being a broadcaster. If you recorded, listen back together or share with other family members.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep announcements very short and simple—just one sentence or phrase. Model frequently and extensively, with the child often repeating your announcements. Focus on effort and confidence rather than clarity of speech. Use very playful, game-like approaches with frequent encouragement. Use only 2-3 stuffed animals as the audience. Keep sessions to 10-15 minutes. Provide significant scaffolding and celebrate every attempt enthusiastically.

**3-4+ years**:
Children can create longer announcements with more detail and sustain roles (news anchor, weather person) across multiple announcements. They enjoy using props and costumes, incorporating humor and silly announcements, and working with a co-announcer in back-and-forth dialogue. Many love recording and replaying their announcements, taking requests for specific types, and understanding simple prompts or notes. Sessions can extend to 20-25 minutes with sustained engagement.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Create a morning announcement ritual where the child makes daily announcements about the weather, schedule, or fun facts.

**Variation 2**: Provide live sports commentary while toys have a race or simple game, narrating the action in announcer style.

**Variation 3**: Create news broadcasts about family or household events: "Breaking news! We found the missing toy!" or "Special report: It's pizza night!"

**Repeat play**: Establish regular broadcasting times (morning news, pre-bedtime announcement, or mealtime announcements). Rotate through different broadcast styles (news, weather, sports, entertainment) to keep interest fresh. Compile multiple announcements into one "broadcast" to replay for the family.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is shy or refuses to broadcast
**Solution**: Don't force it. Start by making announcements yourself while the child listens and provides ideas. Let the child announce to stuffed animals only before trying with people. Gradually increase their role as comfort grows.

**Challenge**: Child's announcements are unclear or mumbled
**Solution**: Model clear, enthusiastic speech frequently. Ask gently: "Can you say that again? I want to hear you." Avoid harsh correction; focus on the effort. Sometimes exaggerating mouth movements helps. Keep announcements very short initially.

**Challenge**: Child goes off-topic, silly, or doesn't "stay in character"
**Solution**: Let it happen! Silliness and improvisation are age-appropriate and developmentally normal. Your role is to encourage confident speaking, not enforce strict structure. Join in the fun: "That's a funny announcement! Make another one!"

**Challenge**: Child wants only adult attention and ignores toy audience
**Solution**: Make the toy audience more interactive by having them respond and react. Sit among the toys as part of the audience. Use toys actively—have them request specific announcements or react to what's shared.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. Record announcements and save them to listen to later, showing growth in confidence and clarity over time.

2. Create a pretend broadcast schedule for the week, planning specific announcement times and types.

3. Use announcements in real daily life by having the child announce actual activities: "Attention family! It's lunch time!" or "Breaking news: We're going to the park!"
