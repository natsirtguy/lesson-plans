## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will establish and operate their own pretend business with a caregiver or peer. They will create or select products to "sell," set up a shop space, determine prices using pretend money or trading items, and take turns being the shopkeeper and customer. This hands-on dramatic play develops entrepreneurial thinking, negotiation skills, creative problem-solving, and social confidence while exploring how real businesses function.

**Activity Type**: Dramatic play/Pretend play business simulation

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Small table or designated shop space
- Items to "sell" (toy blocks, colored paper, wrapped small toys, pictures, stickers, craft items, toy food)
- Pretend money (coins and bills, real coins, or paper versions) OR tokens/beads for trading
- Small basket or bag for customers to hold purchases
- Optional: simple signs or labels to mark items or prices
- Notebook or paper for writing "receipts"

**Optional**:
- Dress-up clothing (apron, cashier vest, or hat to role play)
- Clipboard or receipt pad for taking orders
- Decorated box as a pretend cash register
- Shopping bags for customers
- Items to decorate the shop (flowers, string, banners)
- Picture cards showing products for sale

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (using household items and craft supplies)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Set up a small shop space using a table, shelf, or corner of the room
2. Arrange items for sale on the table or in small organized groups
3. Place pretend money and shopping bags nearby within easy reach
4. Create simple price labels if desired (hand-drawn numbers or pictures)
5. Safety check: Ensure all items are age-appropriate with no small choking hazards

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (3-5 min):
   - Explain: "Today we're going to create our own shop! You'll be the shopkeeper and I'll be a customer who wants to buy things."
   - Show the shop space and items available for sale
   - Ask: "What should we call your shop? What kind of business is it?" (toy store, art gallery, flower shop, etc.)
   - Demonstrate using pretend money: "We'll use these coins to pay for things"
   - Set simple expectations: "Shopkeepers help customers find what they want"

2. **Exploration** (5-7 min):
   - Let the child arrange items for sale on the table the way they want
   - Ask: "Why did you put these things together? What would a customer want to buy?"
   - Help create simple price labels if desired (can be hand-drawn numbers)
   - Allow them to decorate their shop with signs, drawings, or descriptions
   - Ask: "How will customers know what you're selling?"

3. **Discovery** (7-10 min):
   - Begin as a customer: "I'd like to buy something from your shop. Do you have toys?"
   - Let the child show items and explain what they offer and how much they cost
   - Practice exchanges: "I'll give you these 3 coins for that toy. Is that fair?"
   - Ask questions: "How did you make this? Why is it special?"
   - Make purchases and use pretend money or trading items
   - If appropriate, switch roles: "Now you be the customer and I'll run the shop"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   - Count the pretend money earned together
   - Ask reflection: "What was fun about running your shop? Did customers like what you were selling?"
   - Discuss: "You were an entrepreneur today! You created a business and served customers."
   - Help clean up items and put materials away together

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Keep the shop very simple with just 5-7 items
- Use concrete items rather than pretend money (trade toy car for toy block)
- Focus on the exchange and social interaction rather than pricing
- Provide frequent adult narration: "You're selling this car! The customer wants to buy it!"
- Shorter play sessions (10-15 minutes) due to shorter attention span
- Be the main customer and encourage the child to hand you items
- Use familiar items the child knows well

**3-4+ years**:
- Expand with 15-20 items and varied product categories
- Introduce pretend money with basic pricing ("This costs 2 coins")
- Encourage the child to create their own products (draw pictures, wrap toys, make collages)
- Ask more complex questions: "Why did you price it that way? Would customers buy it?"
- Introduce multiple customers (siblings, stuffed animals, imaginary people)
- Allow longer, more complex play with role reversals and story extensions
- Challenge them to think about advertising: "How will customers learn about your shop?"
- Introduce service-based businesses: "car wash" or "salon" where they perform actions

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Multi-Store Market**: Set up multiple small shops (toy store, art gallery, food shop, book store) with different family members or caregivers running each one. Children practice shopping as customers moving between vendors.

**Variation 2: Make and Sell**: Start with children creating products first (drawing pictures, wrapping toys, making playdough items, decorating boxes) then selling them. This adds the manufacturing and creative entrepreneurship element.

**Variation 3: Community Shopping District**: Create a neighborhood with different types of businesses where children set up various shops (bakery, bookstore, clothing store, flower shop, hardware shop) and alternate between being shopkeepers and customers.

**Repeat play**: Change the type of business each time. Introduce new items for sale. Have children create their own products each session. Vary roles between shopkeeper and customer. Introduce themes like "winter gift shop" or "dinosaur museum store."

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is reluctant to be the shopkeeper or feels shy taking on the role
**Solution**: Start by modeling the shopkeeper role yourself and gradually shift responsibility. Use stuffed animals or puppets as customers first to build confidence. Praise specific actions: "You did a great job explaining what your toy does!"

**Challenge**: Arguments or confusion about pricing and fairness of trades
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal! Use it as a teaching moment: "What do you think is fair? How much should this cost?" Help them think through decisions rather than dictating prices. Accept their "business logic" even if not realistic.

**Challenge**: Child gets overwhelmed by too many items or too many customers at once
**Solution**: Scale back to 4-5 items and one customer at a time. Use visual organization (group similar items). Take breaks between customers. Keep play sessions shorter for younger children.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand the pretend money system or abstract trading
**Solution**: For younger children, skip currency entirely and focus on simple direct exchanges. Use large items they can easily handle. Demonstrate repeatedly: "You give me the toy, I give you coins." Use real coins (supervised) as they feel more tangible than paper.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Real-World Connection**: Visit an actual shop or market together and notice the shopkeeper's tasks, displays, and interactions. Ask: "What is this shopkeeper doing? How is it like your pretend shop?"

2. **Create Products for Sale**: Make items specifically for future shop play—draw pictures, decorate boxes, wrap small items, make playdough creations. Ask: "What product should we make for your shop next time?"

3. **Expand the Story**: Create narratives around the business: "Your shop is so popular you need to hire helpers! Who could work with you?" or "A very important customer is coming tomorrow—how will you prepare?"

4. **Visit Real Small Businesses**: With older children, visit a small family business, market stand, or farmer's market. Talk about what the owner does and connect it to pretend play.
