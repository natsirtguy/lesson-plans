# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Calendar and Schedule Making

## Activity Summary

Children will explore the concepts of time, sequencing, and daily routines by creating and manipulating their own simple calendars and schedules. Through hands-on activities with visual representations, they'll develop foundational understanding of days of the week, time order, and predictable routines while building skills in planning and sequential thinking.

## Vocabulary

**Rotation**: One complete spin of the Earth on its axis, which takes approximately 24 hours and gives us one day. The Earth spins at about 1,670 km/h at the equator — we don't feel it because everything moves with us, just like you don't feel a smooth car ride. When our side of the Earth faces the Sun, it's daytime; when it spins away, it's nighttime. Every single day on your calendar is one full rotation of the Earth.

**Orbit**: The path the Earth takes as it travels around the Sun, which takes approximately 365.25 days — one year. That extra quarter-day is why we add a leap day (February 29th) every four years to keep our calendar aligned with Earth's actual position. The tilt of Earth's axis during its orbit creates the seasons: summer when your hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, winter when it tilts away.

**Lunar Cycle**: The Moon orbits the Earth approximately every 29.5 days, cycling through phases from new moon (invisible) to full moon (fully lit) and back. The word "month" comes from "moon" — ancient calendars were based on counting lunar cycles. The Moon doesn't make its own light; we see it because it reflects sunlight, and the changing angle as it orbits creates the phases.

**Circadian Rhythm**: Your body's internal 24-hour clock, controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus — a tiny cluster of about 20,000 neurons in your brain. It tells your body when to feel sleepy (by releasing melatonin) and when to feel alert. Your circadian rhythm is why you get hungry at meal times and sleepy at bedtime even without looking at a clock — your brain tracks the cycle of light and dark through your eyes.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: This Old Man

**Tempo**: Steady and organized

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Calendar shows every day
Helps us plan our work and play
With a schedule, we can see
What our routine's going to be
Days in sequence, one by one
Calendar helps everyone

*Verse 2*
Monday, Tuesday, on we go
Wednesday's next, then more to know
Thursday, Friday come around
Saturday and Sunday found
Seven days make up our week
Calendar's the plan we seek

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point to an imaginary calendar on the wall during "calendar shows every day"
2. Count on fingers for the days of the week during verse 2
3. Draw a big circle in the air showing the weekly cycle during "seven days"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will create a simple visual calendar and daily schedule using pictures, stickers, or drawings. They'll practice putting events in order, learn to recognize patterns in their weekly routine, and develop an understanding that events happen in a predictable sequence. This hands-on exploration helps build early planning and sequencing skills.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on project with sequencing and visual organization

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper or cardstock (8.5" x 11" or larger)
- Markers, crayons, or colored pencils
- Picture cards or printable icons showing daily activities (breakfast, playtime, naptime, etc.)
- Stickers (optional but highly engaging)
- Glue stick or tape

**Optional**:
- Index cards or small cards for individual activities
- Laminating sheets or clear tape (to make it reusable)
- Pocket chart or bulletin board for display
- Photos of the child doing their routine activities

**Cost**: Free to Under $10 (mostly uses items you likely have at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Draw or print simple pictures representing common daily activities: breakfast, getting dressed, playtime, snack time, rest/naptime, outdoor play, meal times, bedtime. Keep pictures simple and clear.
2. Write day labels (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.) on index cards or at the top of your activity paper.
3. Gather markers, stickers, and glue supplies in an accessible area.
4. Decide if you're making a weekly calendar, a daily schedule, or both. Start with daily schedule for younger children.

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   - Show the child a calendar. "Do you know why we have days? It's because the Earth spins! One complete spin — one rotation — takes 24 hours, and that's one day. Every box on this calendar is one rotation of the Earth."
   - Point to the month: "And a month? That comes from the Moon! The Moon takes about 29 days to orbit around the Earth — that's roughly one month."
   - "A whole year is how long it takes Earth to travel all the way around the Sun — one complete orbit. That's 365 days! Today we're going to make our own calendar and schedule."

2. **Exploration** (8-12 minutes):
   - Give the child pictures or let them draw their own activity icons.
   - Ask them to arrange pictures in order of when things happen during their day.
   - Glue or tape pictures onto the schedule paper in the correct sequence.
   - Older children can write time labels (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) or draw clocks.
   - Encourage decoration with stickers or additional drawings.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   - Review the completed schedule. "Notice how your schedule repeats every day — breakfast, play, lunch, nap, play, dinner, sleep? That's a cycle, just like the Earth's rotation cycle!"
   - Connect to circadian rhythm: "Your body has a tiny clock inside your brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. It knows when it's morning and when it's nighttime. That's why you feel hungry at lunch even before we look at the clock — your internal clock is tracking the Earth's rotation!"
   - Point out nested cycles: "Days repeat (rotation). Weeks repeat every 7 days. Months repeat as the Moon orbits. And the year repeats as the Earth orbits the Sun. Cycles inside cycles!"
   - Ask: "Is there anything else we should add? Do we always do things in this order?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   - Display the schedule in a visible place (bedroom, kitchen, playroom).
   - Talk about how you'll use this schedule tomorrow.
   - Sing your calendar song together while pointing to the schedule.
   - Transition to the next activity or preparation for the day.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep it simple with 2-3 major activities per day. Use pictures rather than words. Focus on daily schedule. Connect to astronomy simply: "When we see the Sun, it's daytime — our side of the Earth is facing the Sun. When the Sun goes away, Earth has spun around and it's nighttime!" Use the word "rotation": "One day = one rotation of the Earth." Connect meals to circadian rhythm: "Your tummy gets hungry because your brain's clock says it's time to eat!" Keep to 10-15 minutes.

**3-4+ years**:
Create detailed schedules with 5-7 activities. Introduce day labels and weekly calendar. Explore the astronomy deeper: "Why do we have seasons? Earth is tilted on its axis — like a spinning top that leans to one side. As Earth orbits the Sun, sometimes our hemisphere tilts toward the Sun (summer — longer days, more direct sunlight) and sometimes away (winter — shorter days, less direct sunlight)." Discuss the leap year: "Earth actually takes 365 and a quarter days to orbit the Sun. That extra quarter-day adds up, so every 4 years we add February 29th to keep the calendar accurate." Track Moon phases on the calendar — draw what the Moon looks like each night to discover the 29.5-day lunar cycle. Introduce different calendar systems: "The Chinese calendar follows the Moon, the Islamic calendar follows the Moon too, and our Gregorian calendar follows the Sun. Different civilizations solved the same problem differently!"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Photo Schedule**: Take pictures of your child doing everyday activities (eating, playing, sleeping, getting dressed). Arrange these photos in order to create a personalized photo schedule that's very concrete and meaningful.

**Variation 2 - Weekly Calendar**: Create a larger calendar showing all seven days of the week. Add stickers or drawings for special events (music class on Wednesday, library on Tuesday, grandparent visit on Saturday). Help the child count days until a special event.

**Repeat Play**: Update the schedule as seasons and routines change. Create new versions for different seasons (summer schedule, winter schedule). Let the child lead you through the schedule throughout the week: "It's morning time! What comes first?"

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: The child doesn't put activities in the correct order or doesn't care about sequence.

**Solution**: This is developmentally normal for younger toddlers (2-2.5 years). The goal at this stage is simply exposure to the concept, not perfect accuracy. You can gently suggest correct order ("We eat breakfast before lunch"), but don't insist. They're still learning that events happen in patterns.

**Challenge**: The child wants to change the schedule constantly or becomes upset when actual activities don't match the schedule.

**Solution**: Real life rarely goes exactly as planned! Show flexibility and talk about how our schedule is "a plan, but sometimes things change." Use language like "After this activity, our plan is..." rather than insisting the schedule must be exact. Adapt the schedule together when changes happen.

**Challenge**: The activity feels too long or the child loses interest before finishing.

**Solution**: Reduce the number of activities shown (aim for 3-5 for younger children). Make it faster by pre-drawing or printing pictures. Let them choose which activities to include. Stop and continue another day—there's no rush to complete it all at once.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily schedule reference**: Throughout the day, point to the schedule and say "It's time for... Look, we're doing what our schedule shows!" This builds the connection between the visual representation and real time.

2. **Create a calendar together**: Add one sticker or drawing each day to a monthly calendar. Count down to special events together. This builds understanding of weeks and months.

3. **Talk about routines**: Help your child notice their own routines: "Every morning we get dressed, eat breakfast, then brush teeth. That's our routine!" Point out how routines help us get ready and know what comes next.
