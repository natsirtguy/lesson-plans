# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Calendar and Schedule Making

## Activity Summary

Children will explore the concepts of time, sequencing, and daily routines by creating and manipulating their own simple calendars and schedules. Through hands-on activities with visual representations, they'll develop foundational understanding of days of the week, time order, and predictable routines while building skills in planning and sequential thinking.

## Vocabulary

**Sequence**: The order in which things happen one after another. When you eat breakfast, then snack, then lunch, that's a sequence—each meal comes in a special order, like the steps in a dance.

**Schedule**: A plan that shows what activities will happen at different times. Your daily schedule might show playtime in the morning, snack time at 10 o'clock, and naptime after lunch.

**Calendar**: A tool that helps us keep track of days, weeks, and months. It shows us today's date, helps us see when special days are coming (like birthdays!), and shows us patterns of days that repeat.

**Routine**: A set of activities you do in the same order at the same time, like getting dressed, eating breakfast, and brushing teeth every morning. Routines help our bodies and brains know what comes next.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: This Old Man

**Tempo**: Steady and organized

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Calendar shows every day
Helps us plan our work and play
With a schedule, we can see
What our routine's going to be
Days in sequence, one by one
Calendar helps everyone

*Verse 2*
Monday, Tuesday, on we go
Wednesday's next, then more to know
Thursday, Friday come around
Saturday and Sunday found
Seven days make up our week
Calendar's the plan we seek

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point to an imaginary calendar on the wall during "calendar shows every day"
2. Count on fingers for the days of the week during verse 2
3. Draw a big circle in the air showing the weekly cycle during "seven days"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will create a simple visual calendar and daily schedule using pictures, stickers, or drawings. They'll practice putting events in order, learn to recognize patterns in their weekly routine, and develop an understanding that events happen in a predictable sequence. This hands-on exploration helps build early planning and sequencing skills.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on project with sequencing and visual organization

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper or cardstock (8.5" x 11" or larger)
- Markers, crayons, or colored pencils
- Picture cards or printable icons showing daily activities (breakfast, playtime, naptime, etc.)
- Stickers (optional but highly engaging)
- Glue stick or tape

**Optional**:
- Index cards or small cards for individual activities
- Laminating sheets or clear tape (to make it reusable)
- Pocket chart or bulletin board for display
- Photos of the child doing their routine activities

**Cost**: Free to Under $10 (mostly uses items you likely have at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Draw or print simple pictures representing common daily activities: breakfast, getting dressed, playtime, snack time, rest/naptime, outdoor play, meal times, bedtime. Keep pictures simple and clear.
2. Write day labels (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.) on index cards or at the top of your activity paper.
3. Gather markers, stickers, and glue supplies in an accessible area.
4. Decide if you're making a weekly calendar, a daily schedule, or both. Start with daily schedule for younger children.

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   - Show the child a simple calendar or schedule. Point out the days and activities.
   - Ask: "What do we do first in the morning? What comes next? What happens after snack time?"
   - Explain: "Today we're going to make our own schedule to show all the special things we do."

2. **Exploration** (8-12 minutes):
   - Give the child pictures or let them draw their own activity icons.
   - Ask them to arrange pictures in order of when things happen during their day.
   - Glue or tape pictures onto the schedule paper in the correct sequence.
   - Older children can write time labels (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) or draw clocks.
   - Encourage decoration with stickers or additional drawings.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   - Review the completed schedule together: "What comes first?" "What do we do after playtime?"
   - Point out patterns: "We eat breakfast and lunch every day. Those are on our schedule!"
   - Ask: "Is there anything else we should add? Do we always do things in this order?"
   - Talk about how schedules help us know what's coming next and get ready for activities.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   - Display the schedule in a visible place (bedroom, kitchen, playroom).
   - Talk about how you'll use this schedule tomorrow.
   - Sing your calendar song together while pointing to the schedule.
   - Transition to the next activity or preparation for the day.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep it very simple with just 2-3 major activities per day (breakfast, playtime, naptime). Use mostly pictures rather than words. Focus on daily schedule rather than calendar. Let them place or stick pictures with minimal expectation of "correct" order—the process matters more than the result. Keep activities to 10-15 minutes and provide lots of hand-over-hand assistance with gluing and arranging.

**3-4+ years**:
Create a more detailed schedule with 5-7 activities throughout the day. Introduce day-of-the-week labels and create a weekly mini calendar. Encourage children to predict what comes next and to place items in the correct order independently. Add challenges like: "Can you show when we eat? Can you find two things that happen in the morning?" Create labels together and practice reading them. Make it reusable by using a pocket chart so activities can be moved throughout the week.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Photo Schedule**: Take pictures of your child doing everyday activities (eating, playing, sleeping, getting dressed). Arrange these photos in order to create a personalized photo schedule that's very concrete and meaningful.

**Variation 2 - Weekly Calendar**: Create a larger calendar showing all seven days of the week. Add stickers or drawings for special events (music class on Wednesday, library on Tuesday, grandparent visit on Saturday). Help the child count days until a special event.

**Repeat Play**: Update the schedule as seasons and routines change. Create new versions for different seasons (summer schedule, winter schedule). Let the child lead you through the schedule throughout the week: "It's morning time! What comes first?"

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: The child doesn't put activities in the correct order or doesn't care about sequence.

**Solution**: This is developmentally normal for younger toddlers (2-2.5 years). The goal at this stage is simply exposure to the concept, not perfect accuracy. You can gently suggest correct order ("We eat breakfast before lunch"), but don't insist. They're still learning that events happen in patterns.

**Challenge**: The child wants to change the schedule constantly or becomes upset when actual activities don't match the schedule.

**Solution**: Real life rarely goes exactly as planned! Show flexibility and talk about how our schedule is "a plan, but sometimes things change." Use language like "After this activity, our plan is..." rather than insisting the schedule must be exact. Adapt the schedule together when changes happen.

**Challenge**: The activity feels too long or the child loses interest before finishing.

**Solution**: Reduce the number of activities shown (aim for 3-5 for younger children). Make it faster by pre-drawing or printing pictures. Let them choose which activities to include. Stop and continue another day—there's no rush to complete it all at once.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily schedule reference**: Throughout the day, point to the schedule and say "It's time for... Look, we're doing what our schedule shows!" This builds the connection between the visual representation and real time.

2. **Create a calendar together**: Add one sticker or drawing each day to a monthly calendar. Count down to special events together. This builds understanding of weeks and months.

3. **Talk about routines**: Help your child notice their own routines: "Every morning we get dressed, eat breakfast, then brush teeth. That's our routine!" Point out how routines help us get ready and know what comes next.
