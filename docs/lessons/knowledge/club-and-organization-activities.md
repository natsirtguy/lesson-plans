# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Club and Organization Activities

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Children create and participate in a real club or organization with a shared purpose, learning foundational concepts of governance, democratic process, and civic structure. Through drafting a charter, establishing bylaws, conducting meetings with an agenda, and practicing consensus-based decision-making, children develop organizational thinking, leadership skills, and a sense of belonging to a community built around shared interests — while encountering the same structures that govern real institutions from student councils to national governments.

## Vocabulary

**Charter**: A written document that states why an organization exists and what it will do — its mission and purpose. Real organizations from the United Nations to local scout troops have charters. Example: "Our nature club's charter says our mission is to observe and protect animals and plants."

**Bylaws**: The rules that govern how an organization operates — who can join, how decisions are made, and what happens at meetings. Bylaws are different from regular rules because they apply to the organization itself, not just behavior. Example: "Our bylaws say that every member gets one vote."

**Consensus**: When a group discusses an idea and everyone agrees — or at least no one objects strongly enough to block the decision. Consensus is different from voting because it seeks agreement from everyone, not just a majority. Example: "We reached consensus that our club will meet on Tuesdays."

**Agenda**: A planned list of topics to discuss or things to do at a meeting, written in order. Real organizations publish their agenda before meetings so members can prepare. Example: "The first item on our agenda is choosing a new club project."

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Mary Had a Little Lamb

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*

We wrote a charter for our club
For our club, for our club
We wrote a charter for our club
It says what we will do
We follow bylaws, that's the rules
Everyone gets a fair voice here
We check our agenda every time
And now we're starting new

*Verse 2*

Consensus means we all agree
All agree, all agree
Consensus means we all agree
On choices that we share
We make our plans and take a vote
Everybody gets a turn
We follow our agenda well
Together we all care

**Actions/Gestures**:

1. **Hold up an imaginary paper** when singing "we wrote a charter" — representing the founding document
2. **Make a circle with arms** during "everyone gets a fair voice" — representing inclusion and democratic participation
3. **Thumbs up gesture** during "consensus means we all agree" — the real hand signal used in consensus-based decision making

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children establish their own club or organization by drafting a charter (mission statement), creating bylaws (operating rules), writing an agenda for their first meeting, and practicing democratic decision-making through voting and consensus. They assign governance roles and conduct a real club meeting following their agenda. This hands-on experience teaches organizational structure, civic participation, parliamentary procedure, and the joy of belonging to a self-governing community.

**Activity Type**: Social activity / Organizational play / Group activity

**Duration**: 20-40 minutes (with natural breaks for different club phases)

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Blank paper or cardstock for membership cards
- Stickers, markers, or colored pencils for decorating badges and cards
- Notebooks or small journals for club record-keeping
- Chairs or cushions for a gathering space
- Paper and markers for creating club rules
- Activity supplies specific to the club's purpose (art supplies, blocks, books, music instruments, or nature items)

**Optional**:
- Decorations for club space (banner, sign, fabric drape, or string lights)
- Bell or toy gavel for club meetings
- Snacks for club gatherings (crackers, juice, popcorn)
- Play money or tokens for club dues
- Photos or documentation supplies to record club activities
- Special objects or music related to the club theme

**Cost**: Free (using household items) to under $10 (with decorations and snacks)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Help children identify or discuss what the club's purpose will be (art, music, nature, building, reading, etc.)
2. Designate a specific area as the "club space" - a corner, table, or small room where the club will gather
3. Gather materials appropriate to the club's chosen purpose
4. Prepare blank membership cards and badge materials
5. Have paper and markers ready for creating simple club rules
6. Organize activity supplies so they're accessible to club members
7. Safety check: Ensure the club space is safe for children to gather and explore

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (3-5 minutes):
   - Say: "Today we're founding our own organization! Every real organization — from scout troops to the United Nations — starts by writing a charter. A charter says why the group exists and what it will do."
   - Ask children: "What is our club's mission? What will we do together? What should we name our organization?"
   - Explain: "Every organization needs three things: a charter that explains its purpose, bylaws that are the rules for how it operates, and an agenda for what to do at meetings."
   - Show the blank materials: "We're going to write our charter, create our bylaws, and make an agenda for our first official meeting!"

2. **Exploration** (8-15 minutes):
   - **Phase 1: Draft the Charter** - Together, write a simple charter on paper: the club's name, its mission (purpose), and who can become a member. Explain: "This is like a constitution — the founding document. The United States has a Constitution, and now our club has a charter!" Design an emblem or logo and have each child sign the charter as a founding member.
   - **Phase 2: Establish Bylaws** - Discuss and establish 2-3 bylaws using democratic process. Propose each rule and let children vote: "All in favor, raise your hand!" Count votes and record results. Example bylaws: "All members get one vote," "We follow the agenda," "We take care of our supplies." Explain: "Bylaws are different from regular rules — they govern how our organization itself works." Create a membership roster with names.
   - **Phase 3: Conduct a Meeting with an Agenda** - Write a simple agenda on paper (3 items). Gather in the club space. The designated chairperson (rotate this role) calls the meeting to order: "I call this meeting of [club name] to order. Our first agenda item is..." Work through each agenda item, practicing consensus: "Does everyone agree? Thumbs up for yes, thumbs sideways for unsure, thumbs down for no." Close formally: "This meeting is adjourned."

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   - Discuss the club activity: "What did you enjoy about being in this club? What should we do next time?"
   - Ask children to reflect on their roles: "Who was the leader? Who helped organize? How did we work together?"
   - Assign simple rotating roles (president, activity planner, recorder, timekeeper) so children understand how organizations function
   - Ask: "Should we invite more people to join our club? What will we tell them about?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   - Call the club meeting to close formally: "Our club meeting is now closed. Thank you all for coming!"
   - Celebrate what the club created or did together
   - Help children clean up the club space while preserving the club's identity (keep name sign, rules posted)
   - Say: "Our club will be here tomorrow. We can come back and do more together"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Simplify the club concept: focus on the activity more than organizational structure
- Adult creates the basic club with 1-2 simple rules
- Emphasize the shared activity (art, music, play) rather than club operations
- Shorter meetings (15-20 minutes total)
- Minimal role assignments; mostly gather and do the activity together
- Use concrete, simple language and materials
- Adult maintains the club structure; children participate in activities with high support
- Expect the club concept to be less meaningful; they're joining a fun activity with friends

**3-4+ years**:
- More elaborate club structure with clearer roles and responsibilities
- Children help plan and organize the club itself
- Regular recurring club meetings with established routine
- More sophisticated club activities that develop over multiple meetings
- Children create club materials (name signs, rules posters, decorative badges)
- Voting on decisions and taking turns leading activities
- Inviting others to join the club and teaching them the rules
- Keeping club records or displaying club projects and artwork
- Planning special club events or ongoing projects
- Club meetings with formal structure (opening, activity review, closing)

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Multiple Club Types** - Create several clubs based on different interests in your family or group (art club, nature club, music club, building club, story club, cooking club). Children can be members of multiple clubs.

**Variation 2: Club Growth and Recruitment** - Invite new members to join the club, teach them the rules and traditions, and expand club activities and projects as membership grows.

**Variation 3: Special Club Events** - Plan club field trips (to nature spots, art studios, libraries, parks), club parties, club performances, or special celebrations.

**Variation 4: Community Service Club** - Create a club focused on helping others through collecting items, creating for a cause, or community projects.

**Repeat play**: Keep the club space set up between sessions so children can return to it, continue activities, and add new projects over days or weeks. This allows the club to develop ongoing culture and meaning.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants an exclusive club or doesn't want to include certain people as members.

**Solution**: Young children are learning about inclusion and fairness. Gently expand their thinking: "What if everyone who wants to be in our club can be? We can have many members and still do our activities." Model inclusive thinking without being punitive about exclusionary impulses.

**Challenge**: Club operations become too complex; children lose interest in the organizational aspects.

**Solution**: Club rules, roles, and procedures can be too abstract for young children. Simplify dramatically! Reduce rules to 1-2 essentials. Make roles very concrete (president rings the bell; secretary draws what happened). Focus on the activity more than the organization. Belonging and shared purpose matter more than administrative details.

**Challenge**: The club scope becomes too broad (art club should also have snacks, music, games, storytelling).

**Solution**: This is normal in early club play! Young children haven't fully developed focus on a specific purpose. Gradually help narrow focus: "Today our art club will make art. Next time we can plan a special snack for our meeting." Build identity around one clear purpose while allowing flexibility as the club develops.

**Challenge**: Interest fades after initial club creation; children stop attending club meetings.

**Solution**: Novelty wears off and club operations can feel tedious. Introduce new elements periodically: special guest members, new activities, club projects, or field trips. Vary the routine to keep it fresh. It's fine if a club goes dormant and restarts when interest naturally reignites.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Club Documentation** - Keep a club journal or photo album documenting club meetings, activities, members, and projects. Children can draw or paste photos to record the club's history and growth.

2. **Real-World Club Exploration** - Visit or learn about real clubs in your community (library programs, sports teams, art classes, music groups). Discuss how these real organizations are similar to the club children created.

3. **Club Celebration** - Plan a special club celebration where members showcase what they've created, invite family members to observe a club meeting, or hold a "club appreciation day" where you celebrate membership and accomplishments.
