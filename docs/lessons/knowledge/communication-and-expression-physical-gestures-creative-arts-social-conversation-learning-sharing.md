# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Communication and Expression

## Activity Summary

Children explore multiple ways to express themselves beyond words—through physical gestures, creative art, conversation, and sharing what they've learned. This lesson celebrates all the ways we communicate and connect with others, building confidence in self-expression and social interaction.

## Vocabulary

**Verbal communication**: Communication using words — spoken or written. Only humans have spoken language with grammar: rules that let us combine words in infinite new ways. Babies aren't born speaking; they learn language by hearing it, which is why talking to babies matters from day one.

**Nonverbal communication**: Communication without words — facial expressions, gestures, body posture, touch, and even silence. Researchers estimate that a large portion of human communication is nonverbal. You can tell a lot about how someone feels just by watching their face and body, before they say a word.

**Symbol**: Something that *stands for* or *represents* something else. A drawing of a heart represents love. A red traffic light represents "stop." The letter "A" is a symbol for a sound. Human language and art are built from symbols — one of the things that makes humans unique among animals.

**Paralanguage**: The way you say something — your tone of voice, pitch, speed, and volume — which changes the meaning even when the words stay the same. "Fine" said warmly means something very different from "fine" said coldly. Paralanguage carries enormous meaning.

**Gesture**: A body movement that communicates a message. Many gestures are culturally specific — a thumbs-up means "good" in some countries but is rude in others. However, some facial expressions (like smiling for happiness or frowning for sadness) appear to be universal across all human cultures, which scientists think are built into our biology.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Baa, Baa, Black Sheep

**Tempo**: Upbeat and friendly

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
We communicate each day
We express in many ways
Wave a gesture, create art
Use your voice to share your heart
We communicate each day
Show your feelings when you play

*Verse 2*
Talk and listen, laugh and sing
Drawing shows most everything
Make a face to say hello
Tell your friends the things you know
Talk and listen, laugh and sing
Communication's everything

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Wave hands and point during "wave a gesture" showing hand communication
2. Make drawing motions in the air during "create art" and "drawing shows"
3. Point to mouth during "talk" and cup hand behind ear during "listen"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore the difference between verbal and nonverbal communication by testing whether they can make themselves understood without words, learning about sign language as a complete language, and discovering that symbols (drawings, gestures) represent ideas — one of the core abilities that makes human communication unique.

**Activity Type**: Discovery exploration with multiple stations

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper (8.5" x 11" or larger)
- Crayons, markers, or colored pencils
- A mirror (small handheld or face a window)
- Simple props (toy, book, stuffed animal)
- Your own facial expressions and voice

**Optional**:
- Stickers
- Paint or watercolors
- Block toys or building materials
- Pictures of emotions (happy, sad, surprised)

**Cost**: Free (uses common household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Set up 4 simple exploration areas: one in front of a mirror, one with drawing materials, one with a toy or book to discuss, and one open space for movement
2. Gather all materials within reach
3. Choose a calm, distraction-free area with room to move around

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Start with a challenge: "I'm going to tell you something without using any words. Ready?" Use a gesture or facial expression to communicate something simple (point to a toy, make a hungry face, wave hello). "Did you understand me? That's *nonverbal* communication — sending messages without words!"

   Explain: "Humans use two main types of communication: *verbal* (using words) and *nonverbal* (faces, hands, pictures). Today we're going to explore both."

2. **Silent Communication Challenge** (5-6 minutes):
   Play "no-words communication":
   - Caregiver tries to tell the child to do something (sit down, give a hug, point to something in the room) using only face and body — no words. Child guesses.
   - Switch: child tries to communicate something silently to caregiver.
   - Discuss: "Some messages are easy without words (hungry, happy, stop). Some are hard — try telling me your favorite dinosaur without words!" This makes the limits and strengths of nonverbal communication concrete and memorable.

3. **Sign Language Introduction** (3-4 minutes):
   "Some people communicate using sign language — a complete language made entirely of hand shapes, movements, and facial expressions. American Sign Language is called ASL. It has its own grammar, just like spoken English — it's not just 'English with hands.'"

   Teach 3-4 simple ASL signs: *more*, *please*, *thank you*, *all done*. (These are genuinely useful signs for toddlers who can sign before they can speak clearly.)

   "Deaf people around the world have developed hundreds of different sign languages — each one a full language."

4. **Symbols in Art** (3-4 minutes):
   With drawing materials: "Let's draw some *symbols* — pictures that mean something. Draw a heart. What does a heart represent? Love — but there's nothing lovey about the actual shape, we all just agreed it means love. That's a symbol."

   Have the child draw symbols for: happy, home, food, friend. Discuss: "These symbols work because we both know what they mean. All written language works this way — letters are symbols for sounds."

5. **Discovery** (2-3 minutes):
   Ask: "What would it feel like if you could *never* use words?" (just gestures) "What would be easy? What would be hard?" "Can you think of any animals that communicate without words?" (bees dance to show direction to flowers; dogs wag tails; dolphins use clicks and whistles)

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on the silent communication game and ASL signs — both are immediately practical (toddlers who know the sign for "more" or "all done" can communicate needs before they have the spoken words). Use the words "verbal" and "nonverbal" naturally without demanding comprehension. Skip the deeper symbol discussion and just draw and name together: "I drew a heart — that means love!"

**3-4+ years**:
Explore cultural differences in gestures: "In some countries, nodding your head means *no*, and shaking it means *yes* — the opposite of what we do! Gestures are *cultural*, they're learned, not born." Introduce the concept of *body language* and how it gives away feelings even when someone's words say something different. Ask: "If I say 'I'm fine' but my face looks sad, which one should you believe?" This builds emotional intelligence and empathy — understanding that communication is about more than just words.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Emotion Faces**: Create simple emotion faces together using paper plates, markers, and stickers. Glue them on popsicle sticks and use as puppets to act out different feelings.

**Variation 2 - Communication Scavenger Hunt**: Around your home or yard, find things that communicate: a sign, a picture, a toy, a bell, a window (which shows the world). Talk about what each one "says."

**Variation 3 - Gesture Stories**: Tell a simple story using only gestures and movements, no words. Start with "Once upon a time, there was a butterfly." Let the child show butterfly movements. Continue: "The butterfly flew through the flowers." Let them create the actions. Build the story together where children predict and create gestures for what happens next.

**Repeat play**: Change the conversation topic each time ("Tell me about your favorite food," "What did you see today?"). Rotate which type of expression gets the most attention. Over multiple sessions, children grow more confident and expressive each time.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is shy or refuses to make expressions or speak during conversation station.

**Solution**: Respect their pace. Never force participation. Instead, model the expressions yourself enthusiastically. Say: "When I'm happy, I smile like this." Let them observe. Sometimes children participate better when they're watching you rather than being asked directly. Gradually, as they feel safe, they'll join in. Shy expressions of communication are still valid communication.

**Challenge**: Child spends all the time at one station and doesn't want to move to others.

**Solution**: This is perfectly fine! Children learn through deep, extended play. If they want to spend 20 minutes drawing, that is communication and creation in action. You don't need to rush through all stations. Follow their lead and trust their learning process.

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated when their art "doesn't look like" something.

**Solution**: Reframe the activity. Emphasize: "There is no right or wrong in art. Your marks and colors are expressing what you feel. That is what makes it beautiful—it comes from you." Avoid asking "What is it?" Instead, say "Tell me about your creation" or "I love the colors you chose." This shifts focus from resemblance to personal expression.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't use many words during conversation time.

**Solution**: Accept all forms of communication equally. Pointing, gestures, facial expressions, and simple sounds are all valid communication. Ask yes/no or choice questions instead of open-ended ones. Model language for them: "You're pointing at the truck. That's a big red truck!" over time, exposure and modeling builds vocabulary without pressure.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Communication Journal**: Keep a simple sketchbook where the child draws or scribbles daily to express their feelings. Review it together and celebrate how they're communicating.

2. **Storytelling Together**: Take turns adding one sentence to a story. This builds conversational skills and shows that sharing ideas creates something together.

3. **Real-World Connection**: Throughout the day, point out communication: "Look, that person is waving hello!" "I'm using my words to tell you I need help." "You're drawing about what you love—that's expressing yourself!"
