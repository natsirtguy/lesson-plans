# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Communication and Expression

## Activity Summary

Children explore multiple ways to express themselves beyond words—through physical gestures, creative art, conversation, and sharing what they've learned. This lesson celebrates all the ways we communicate and connect with others, building confidence in self-expression and social interaction.

## Vocabulary

**Express**: To share your feelings, ideas, or messages using your body, voice, or art instead of just words. When you draw a picture of your favorite toy or dance to happy music, you are expressing joy.

**Gesture**: A movement of your hand, arm, head, or body that communicates a message or feeling. Waving bye-bye is a gesture that says goodbye, and nodding your head is a gesture that means yes.

**Communicate**: To share information, feelings, or ideas with others so they understand what you mean. You communicate when you talk, draw, point, or make facial expressions.

**Create**: To make something new and original that shows what you are thinking or feeling. When you paint a picture or build with blocks, you are creating something that is uniquely yours.

## Learning Song

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children participate in a "Communication Station" exploration where they try multiple ways to express themselves: making faces and gestures, creating art, having conversations, and sharing what they learned. This hands-on activity shows children that there are many ways to tell others what they're thinking and feeling.

**Activity Type**: Discovery exploration with multiple stations

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper (8.5" x 11" or larger)
- Crayons, markers, or colored pencils
- A mirror (small handheld or face a window)
- Simple props (toy, book, stuffed animal)
- Your own facial expressions and voice

**Optional**:
- Stickers
- Paint or watercolors
- Block toys or building materials
- Pictures of emotions (happy, sad, surprised)

**Cost**: Free (uses common household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Set up 4 simple exploration areas: one in front of a mirror, one with drawing materials, one with a toy or book to discuss, and one open space for movement
2. Gather all materials within reach
3. Choose a calm, distraction-free area with room to move around

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Introduce the idea: "Today we're exploring all the different ways we can tell people what we're thinking and feeling. We can use our faces, our bodies, our voices, and our hands. Let's discover all these amazing ways to communicate!"

2. **Exploration** (5-10 minutes):
   Guide the child through the stations in order. At the mirror: "Can you make a happy face? A surprised face? A sleepy face?" Try gestures together: wave, clap, give thumbs up, point to show excitement. With drawing materials: "Draw your favorite thing" or "Show me a happy color." During conversation: Ask open-ended questions about a toy or book: "What do you like about this?" "Can you tell me a story?" Model interested listening by leaning in, making eye contact, and asking follow-up questions. In the movement area: "Show me how a happy person moves. How does a sleepy person walk?" Mirror their movements and invite them to teach you.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   Pause and highlight what you've observed together: "You made so many different faces! You created beautiful colors in your drawing. You told me a wonderful story. You showed me how to move like a bouncy puppy!" Ask questions like: "Which way of sharing was your favorite?" "How did your body feel when you moved?" "What did your art tell me about what you like?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   Review what you explored together. Say: "We used our faces, our hands, our voices, and our art to tell stories and show feelings. Everyone communicates in their own special way. You are wonderful at expressing yourself!" Celebrate with a group gesture like waving, clapping, or dancing together.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus mainly on simple gestures and facial expressions (clapping, waving, big smiles)
- Keep drawing time short and allow lots of scribbling without direction
- Use very simple, concrete language ("happy," "wave," "smile")
- Repeat the same expressions multiple times before introducing new ones
- Let them lead—follow their interest instead of moving through all stations if they're engaged in one
- Offer more hand-over-hand modeling and physical guidance

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce more complex emotions (surprised, confused, excited, sleepy)
- Ask children to create art with purpose ("draw your favorite animal," "paint a happy day")
- Encourage longer conversations with questions like "Why do you like that?" and "What happens next?"
- Introduce the idea that different people communicate differently: "Some people are very quiet, and some are very loud. Both are okay!"
- Ask them to teach YOU a gesture or expression, building confidence as a communicator
- Encourage them to describe or tell stories about their creations in more detail

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Emotion Faces**: Create simple emotion faces together using paper plates, markers, and stickers. Glue them on popsicle sticks and use as puppets to act out different feelings.

**Variation 2 - Communication Scavenger Hunt**: Around your home or yard, find things that communicate: a sign, a picture, a toy, a bell, a window (which shows the world). Talk about what each one "says."

**Variation 3 - Gesture Stories**: Tell a simple story using only gestures and movements, no words. Start with "Once upon a time, there was a butterfly." Let the child show butterfly movements. Continue: "The butterfly flew through the flowers." Let them create the actions. Build the story together where children predict and create gestures for what happens next.

**Repeat play**: Change the conversation topic each time ("Tell me about your favorite food," "What did you see today?"). Rotate which type of expression gets the most attention. Over multiple sessions, children grow more confident and expressive each time.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is shy or refuses to make expressions or speak during conversation station.

**Solution**: Respect their pace. Never force participation. Instead, model the expressions yourself enthusiastically. Say: "When I'm happy, I smile like this." Let them observe. Sometimes children participate better when they're watching you rather than being asked directly. Gradually, as they feel safe, they'll join in. Shy expressions of communication are still valid communication.

**Challenge**: Child spends all the time at one station and doesn't want to move to others.

**Solution**: This is perfectly fine! Children learn through deep, extended play. If they want to spend 20 minutes drawing, that is communication and creation in action. You don't need to rush through all stations. Follow their lead and trust their learning process.

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated when their art "doesn't look like" something.

**Solution**: Reframe the activity. Emphasize: "There is no right or wrong in art. Your marks and colors are expressing what you feel. That is what makes it beautiful—it comes from you." Avoid asking "What is it?" Instead, say "Tell me about your creation" or "I love the colors you chose." This shifts focus from resemblance to personal expression.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't use many words during conversation time.

**Solution**: Accept all forms of communication equally. Pointing, gestures, facial expressions, and simple sounds are all valid communication. Ask yes/no or choice questions instead of open-ended ones. Model language for them: "You're pointing at the truck. That's a big red truck!" over time, exposure and modeling builds vocabulary without pressure.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Communication Journal**: Keep a simple sketchbook where the child draws or scribbles daily to express their feelings. Review it together and celebrate how they're communicating.

2. **Storytelling Together**: Take turns adding one sentence to a story. This builds conversational skills and shows that sharing ideas creates something together.

3. **Real-World Connection**: Throughout the day, point out communication: "Look, that person is waving hello!" "I'm using my words to tell you I need help." "You're drawing about what you love—that's expressing yourself!"
