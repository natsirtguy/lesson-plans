# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Community Garden and Clean-Up Activities

## Activity Summary

In this lesson, children learn that communities work together to care for shared spaces through gardening and clean-up activities. Young learners will explore soil, plant seeds, water plants, and participate in simple outdoor clean-up tasks—developing environmental awareness, responsibility, and understanding of collaboration while building fine and gross motor skills.

## Vocabulary

**Community**: A group of people living or working together in the same area. When families plant a garden together or pick up trash in a neighborhood park, they are caring for their community.

**Cultivate**: To grow something by taking care of it. When you plant seeds and water them every day so they become healthy plants, you are cultivating a garden.

**Compost**: Organic materials like food scraps, leaves, and grass clippings that break down into rich, dark soil for growing plants. You can create compost to feed your garden and help plants grow strong.

**Stewardship**: The responsibility to care for and protect something. When you take care of a garden or clean up trash in a park, you show stewardship for nature and your community.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will participate in hands-on gardening and outdoor clean-up by planting seeds in containers, watering plants, and collecting natural items to tidy up a garden space. Through this sensory-rich experience, they learn that their actions help living things grow and that caring for shared spaces creates community pride and environmental responsibility.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration, hands-on planting, outdoor clean-up, collaborative play

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Small containers, pots, or recycled yogurt cups (one per child)
- Potting soil or garden soil
- Seeds (large, easy-to-handle varieties like sunflower, bean, or pumpkin seeds)
- Watering can or spray bottle
- Small gardening tool or sturdy spoon for digging
- Outdoor space (garden, patio, or grassy area)
- Gloves sized for small hands (optional but recommended)

**Optional**:
- Stickers or markers to decorate pots with child's name
- Aprons to protect clothing
- Natural items to collect (sticks, leaves, small rocks)
- Basket or bucket for gathering clean-up items
- Camera to document planting progress

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (if using recycled containers and purchased seeds)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Fill containers with soil ahead of time or have soil in a shallow bin for children to scoop
2. Set up a watering station with water in a low, accessible container
3. Lay out all materials on a low table or tarp outdoors
4. Safety check: Ensure the area is free of sharp objects, pesticides, and hazards

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Gather children and show them the soil, seeds, and containers. Say: "Today we're going to plant seeds together, just like gardeners do. Our seeds need soil, water, and sunlight to grow. We're going to help them grow!" Pass around a seed so each child can hold it and examine it closely.

2. **Exploration** (10-12 min):

   *Part A - Planting (6-8 min)*:
   - Have each child place soil in their container (they can scoop it themselves or you can provide pre-filled pots for younger toddlers)
   - Guide them to poke 2-3 small holes in the soil with their finger or spoon
   - Help them place a seed in each hole and gently cover with soil
   - Optional: Decorate the pot with stickers or draw the child's name

   *Part B - Watering (2-3 min)*:
   - Bring containers to the watering station
   - Show children how to water gently (demonstrate pouring slowly or misting)
   - Let each child water their own plant with your gentle guidance
   - Talk about how water helps seeds sprout

   *Part C - Clean-Up Exploration (2-3 min)*:
   - Transition to a nearby outdoor area with natural items
   - Invite children to collect fallen leaves, small sticks, and rocks in a basket
   - Explain: "We're helping keep our garden and outdoor space clean and safe"

3. **Discovery** (3-4 min):
   Point out observations: "Do you see how dark the soil is? That's because it's full of food for plants. The seeds will stay under the soil where it's warm and dark until they're ready to grow. Let's watch for sprouts next week!" Ask questions: "What do you think the seed needs to grow? What did you find during clean-up? How does it feel to help?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Gather the group and celebrate their work: "You planted seeds and helped clean up our space. That's what communities do—we work together to care for our neighborhood. Your plants will grow because of the hard work you did today!" Take a photo of the children with their planted containers or the items they collected.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use larger seeds (sunflower or bean) that are easier to grasp and manipulate
- Provide pre-filled containers with soil so they focus on planting and watering
- Use a squirt bottle or spray bottle for watering instead of a traditional watering can (easier to control)
- Keep clean-up activity very simple: collecting large, soft items like leaves (not sticks)
- Offer a sensory table with soil separate from the planting activity if digging is the main interest
- Expect shorter attention span; aim for 10-12 minutes total

**3-4+ years**:
- Use medium-sized seeds and challenge them to plant multiple seeds in different containers
- Let them fill their own containers with soil and press it down
- Teach them to water until soil is moist but not soaking
- Extend clean-up to include gathering sticks, rocks, and leaves for a "nature collage" after
- Ask them to predict what will happen next ("Do you think something will grow?")
- Introduce simple record-keeping: draw or mark today's date on the pot
- Encourage them to care for the plant over multiple days and observe changes

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Sensory Garden Exploration**: Create a small sensory station with different types of soil, compost, sand, and pebbles. Let children touch and explore the textures while you explain how each material helps plants grow. This deepens understanding of what plants need.

**Variation 2 - Community Service Clean-Up**: Organize a bigger clean-up walk around your neighborhood or local park. Give each child a gloved hand or a small basket and walk together collecting litter. Afterward, talk about how they helped their community.

**Repeat Play - Growing Journal**: Revisit the planted seeds multiple times over the following weeks. Take photos or drawings of the containers as sprouts emerge, leaves grow, and eventually small plants develop. Children develop patience and understanding of growth cycles while building excitement about their project.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child puts soil in mouth or wants to eat seeds
**Solution**: This is normal sensory exploration at this age. Provide clean, food-grade soil or offer safe edible exploration with pumpkin seeds at snack time. Supervise closely and gently redirect: "Soil goes in the pot, not in our mouth. But we can wash our hands and have a snack later."

**Challenge**: Seeds don't sprout or sprout very slowly
**Solution**: This is a valuable learning opportunity about patience and care. Check that soil stays moist (not soggy), that seeds are fresh and viable, and that the location has adequate light. Even if sprouting is delayed, children learn that growth takes time. Consider planting fast-growing seeds like beans for quicker results.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest in watering or caring for the plant
**Solution**: Break caregiving into small, memorable moments. Water together once daily at the same time, sing the song while watering, or let them choose when to water. Celebrate small changes: "Look! The soil is darker today because we watered!"

**Challenge**: Weather prevents outdoor activity
**Solution**: Move the planting indoors on a windowsill or table near a window. Set up an indoor sensory bin with soil and digging toys. Clean-up can happen indoors with a basket of items to organize or sort.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Plant Growth Observation**: Over the next 2-3 weeks, regularly water plants together and observe sprouting. Draw pictures or take photos to record changes. This reinforces patience, care responsibility, and scientific observation.

2. **Harvest and Share**: When plants produce food (if growing vegetables), harvest together and share with family or friends. This extends the cycle of community care and shows the full benefit of gardening.

3. **Community Connection**: Visit a local community garden, farmers market, or park as a family. Point out gardens and clean spaces. Talk about how people in the community care for these places together.
