## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- "Today we're going to help our community! We can plant a garden / clean up our space"
- Explain: "When we all work together, we make our community more beautiful and healthy"
- Show what you'll do: "We're going to plant these seeds. They'll grow into plants!"
- Ask: "Why do you think plants are important? Why do clean spaces feel good?"

**Setting expectations**:
- "We work together as a team"
- "This work is important and helpful"
- Success means you tried, helped, and felt proud of your work

### Main Activity (15-30 minutes)

**OPTION A: GARDENING FOCUS**

**Phase 1: Preparation and Exploration** (4-6 minutes)
Children learn about plants and soil
- Let them feel the soil: "Soil gives plants food. Feel how soft it is?"
- Show seeds or seedlings: "These will grow into big plants!"
- Ask: "What does a plant need? Water? Sunlight? Good soil?"
- Explain their role: "You're going to help plants grow!"

**Phase 2: Planting Together** (8-12 minutes)
Children actively plant
- Demonstrate digging: "Make a little hole for the seed"
- Let them dig holes with trowels or fingers
- Place seeds in holes: "One seed per hole. Gently now."
- Cover with soil: "Pat it down so seeds stay put"
- Water gently: "Plants need to drink water just like us"
- Narrate the process: "You're a gardener! You're helping new plants start!"

**Phase 3: Care and Celebration** (remaining time)
Children tend their garden
- Identify their plants: mark or remember locations
- Create plant markers: draw pictures, write names
- Create watering schedule: "Who waters tomorrow?"
- Walk through garden: "Look what we made together!"
- Plan for watching growth: "We'll check every day"

**OPTION B: CLEAN-UP FOCUS**

**Phase 1: Exploration and Planning** (3-5 minutes)
Children survey the space
- Walk through area together: "What needs cleaning?"
- Let them identify items, debris, untidy areas
- Ask: "Why does it feel good to have a clean space?"
- Make a simple plan: "First we collect big things, then small"

**Phase 2: Active Clean-Up** (10-15 minutes)
Children work on cleaning
- Divide tasks: "You collect leaves. You sweep."
- Demonstrate techniques: show how to sweep, rake, collect
- Provide encouragement: "You're making a difference!"
- Work alongside them: model effort and care
- Change tasks if interest wanes: offer different clean-up work
- Let them see results: "Look how much cleaner this is!"

**Phase 3: Finishing Touches** (remaining time)
Children complete and celebrate
- Final touches: arrange cleaned items, sweep final area
- Look together at the result: "Doesn't this look great?"
- Celebrate their work: "We made this community space beautiful!"
- Plan next clean-up: "Should we do this again?"

**Adult role**:
- Work alongside children, not just directing
- Model effort, care, and pride in work
- Notice and comment on helpful actions
- Break tasks into simple steps
- Provide tools and clear directions
- Step back when children are engaged
- Provide encouragement and celebration

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Gather and reflect on work together
- Ask: "What did we accomplish? How do you feel?"
- Celebrate specific contributions: "You planted three seeds!"
- Reflect on meaning: "We helped our community today"
- Take a photo of garden or cleaned space

**Transition to cleanup**:
- Clean up gardening/clean-up tools together
- Wash hands and feet thoroughly
- Rest and enjoy cool drink or snack
- Reflect calmly on the experience

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Approach**:
- Very simple gardening: putting seeds in pre-made holes, watering
- Or very simple clean-up: collecting large items, sweeping (with help)
- Keep tasks concrete and short
- Expect to do most of the work together
- Focus on participation and exploration more than results

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Adult support**:
- Heavy hands-on help with all tasks
- Demonstrate everything first
- One step at a time
- Watch closely for safety (some children eat dirt)
- Manage tools carefully
- Provide constant guidance

### 3-4+ years

**Extensions**:
- More complex gardening: planning layout, tending to multiple plants, tracking growth
- More responsibility for clean-up: larger areas, more independence
- Add role-play: farmer, landscaper, park caretaker
- Create plant labels with drawings and letters
- Keep garden journal with pictures
- Discuss plant life cycle
- Plan for sharing harvest or maintenance schedule

**Duration**: May sustain 30-40 minutes with ongoing responsibilities

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Seasonal Garden**
Plant different seeds/plants by season. Track changes, celebrate harvest, plan for next season.

**Variation 2: Pollinator Garden**
Focus on creating habitat for bees and butterflies. Discuss insects, observe pollinators, learn about food chains.

**Variation 3: Neighborhood Clean-Up Crew**
Create ongoing clean-up initiative for local park or community space. Build routine and community connection.

**Thematic variations**:
- Butterfly or bee garden
- Flower or vegetable garden
- Herb garden for cooking
- Pizza garden (ingredients for pizza)
- Sensory garden (different textures and scents)
- Community mural while doing clean-up
- Seasonal decorations for public space

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Gardening and tending to community spaces are practices across all human cultures. From traditional agriculture to community gardens in cities, growing food and caring for shared spaces are fundamental to human experience. Many cultures celebrate harvest festivals and have sacred relationships with land. This activity connects children to these universal human practices.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Discuss gardens from different cultures (Asian gardens, African farming traditions, Indigenous practices)
- Show different types of gardens worldwide
- Talk about how different cultures celebrate plants and harvest
- Include plants that grow in different parts of the world
- Discuss how people in different climates grow food
- Share cultural celebrations related to planting and harvest

**Books/Media**:
- "From Seed to Plant" by Gail Gibbons (plant life cycle)
- "The Little Blue Truck" by Alice Schertle (community cooperation)
- "Planting a Rainbow" by Lois Ehlert (gardening colors and variety)
- "What Do Roots Do?" by Rachel Kudela (plant growth)

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Children put dirt/soil in mouth
**Why**: Oral exploration is normal for 2-3 year-olds. Tastes are interesting to them.
**Solution**: Watch closely and gently redirect: "We don't eat dirt. Dirt is for plants." Keep hands busy with digging or planting. Consider doing this activity with slightly older supervision. Ensure soil is clean and pesticide-free if you can't prevent tasting.

**Challenge**: Children want to dig/pull up plants instead of plant them
**Why**: Exploring and pulling apart is developmentally interesting. Fine motor control is still developing.
**Solution**: Give them a designated area to dig in if possible. Show them the right action carefully: "We dig holes here, not pull plants." Let them explore the soil experience while protecting planted areas.

**Challenge**: Children lose interest in repetitive tasks
**Why**: Sustained repetitive work is cognitively challenging for young children
**Solution**: Rotate tasks frequently. Celebrate progress: "Look how many you've done!" Make it fun with songs or imagination: "We're superhero gardeners!" Let them do what they can, don't force completion.

### Tips for Success
- Start with fast-growing seeds so results are visible (bean seeds, sunflower)
- Keep clean-up areas small and manageable
- Work alongside them the whole time
- Use simple tools designed for children
- Make it playful: singing, imagining, celebrating
- Notice and celebrate effort, not just results
- Dress for mess - get dirty together
- Connect to real community: "We're helping take care of our neighborhood"

### What to Do With the Creation
- For gardens: visit regularly, water together, watch growth, celebrate harvest
- For clean-ups: take before and after photos, revisit to maintain
- Document growth with photos or sketches
- Share accomplishment with family: "Look what we grew!"
- Involve in ongoing care and responsibility
- Celebrate completion and plan next project
