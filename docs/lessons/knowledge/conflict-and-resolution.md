# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Conflict and Resolution

## Activity Summary

Children learn that disagreements are normal and that there are helpful ways to solve problems together. Through guided activities, songs, and role-play scenarios, they discover how to use words, take turns, and find solutions where everyone feels better. This lesson builds foundational conflict resolution skills and emotional regulation.

## Vocabulary

**Conflict**: A disagreement between two or more people who have different wants, needs, or feelings. Conflicts are normal and happen in every relationship — even between people who love each other very much. What matters is not avoiding conflict but resolving it well.

**Emotional regulation**: The ability to manage and calm down strong emotions like anger, frustration, or fear. When we're very upset, a part of our brain called the **amygdala** triggers a "fight or flight" response — our heart beats faster, our muscles tense up, and our thinking brain partly shuts off. You literally *cannot* think clearly or solve problems while you're in this state. That's why "calm down first, solve it second" is not just advice — it's neuroscience.

**"I" statements**: A way of expressing feelings that describes your own experience rather than accusing the other person. Instead of "You took my toy!" (a "you" statement that sounds like an attack), try "I feel sad when I don't have a turn" (an "I" statement that explains your feeling). "You" statements trigger defensiveness; "I" statements open conversation.

**Interests vs. positions**: A key idea in negotiation. Your *position* is what you say you want ("I want that toy!"). Your *interest* is *why* you want it ("I want something to hold while I'm tired"). When you understand the real interest behind a position, new solutions often appear. Two children both want the last orange — that's their position. One wants to eat it; one wants the peel for a craft. If they share (each gets what they actually want), both interests are met.

**Empathy**: Understanding and sharing another person's feelings — trying to imagine their experience from the inside. Empathy is a skill that can be practiced and strengthened. It's the foundation of all good conflict resolution: if you can genuinely understand why the other person feels the way they do, solutions become much easier to find.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: "Wheels on the Bus"

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 8-8-12 syllables per verse):

*Verse 1*
When we have a problem, what do we do?
What do we do?
When we have a problem, what do we do?
We use kind words all day long.

*Verse 2*
We can share and take a turn, take a turn, take a turn.
We can share and take a turn,
That's how friends work out their problems,
And everyone feels better!

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Hold hands up in "problem" shape (palms facing each other, slightly apart) when singing about problems, then bring hands together when singing about solutions
2. Point to mouth when singing "use kind words"
3. Alternate arms in taking-turns motion when singing "take a turn"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will engage in guided role-play and problem-solving scenarios using puppets or stuffed animals to act out common conflicts and discover solutions together. This allows them to safely practice conflict resolution skills in a playful, non-threatening way while building empathy and understanding of different perspectives.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on demonstration with role-play and puppetry

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Two hand puppets or stuffed animals (different types work best—e.g., bunny and bear)
- Simple props: toy block, toy car, or plush ball (something two puppets might "want")
- Open floor space for puppet theater

**Optional**:
- Small cardboard box or fabric as puppet theater background
- Picture cards showing conflict scenarios
- Reward chart or stickers for practicing kind words

**Cost**: Free (using toys you likely have) or under $5 (if purchasing inexpensive puppets)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Select two distinct hand puppets or stuffed animals and familiarize yourself with using them expressively
2. Choose a small toy or prop that will be the "contested item" in the conflict scenario
3. Create a simple staging area (puppet theater can be as simple as sitting behind a blanket draped over a chair)
4. Clear a safe space for the child to move around and potentially join in role-play

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Introduce the two puppets. Then briefly introduce the brain concept: "When you get really, really upset — when someone takes your toy or something feels very unfair — your brain sets off a kind of alarm. Your heart goes fast, your face gets hot, and it's hard to think. That's your brain protecting you. But here's the thing: when that alarm is going off, it's really hard to solve problems. So step one of fixing any fight is: calm the alarm first."

   Demonstrate: take three slow breaths, shoulders dropping. "That's real. Slow breaths actually help turn off the alarm. Scientists can measure it."

2. **Exploration - Scenario 1** (5 min):
   **The Conflict**: Have both puppets reach for the same toy.
   - Puppet 1 says: "I want to play with this toy!"
   - Puppet 2 says: "No! I want it!"
   - Exaggerate frustrated movements and voices (but not scary)
   - Ask the child: "Oh no! What's the problem here? Both puppets want the toy. Do you think they're happy?"

3. **Exploration - Scenario 2** (5 min):
   **Finding a Solution**: Replay the scenario, this time modeling the skills.

   First, the "you" statement problem: Have Puppet 1 say "YOU always take my stuff! You're being mean!" Ask: "How does Bear feel when Bunny says that? Does it make Bear want to share?" Probably not — it triggers defensiveness.

   Then, the "I" statement: Have Puppet 1 try again: "I feel sad when I don't get a turn. I really wanted to play with that."
   Ask: "That sounds different! How does Bear feel now?" Much easier to respond to.

   Then, exploring interests: "Why does Bunny want the toy? (to make a pretend cake) Why does Bear want it? (to roll it down a ramp) Oh! They want it for different reasons! What if Bunny has it for pretend cooking, and Bear uses it for the ramp after? Both interests are met!"

4. **Guided Practice** (3-4 min):
   Create a second simple scenario with the child's input:
   - "Bunny wants to build with blocks. Bear wants to build too. What could they do?"
   - Guide the child to suggest solutions (sharing blocks, building together, taking turns)
   - Have the puppets act out the child's suggestion
   - Celebrate: "You found a great solution!"

5. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Have both puppets give the child a gentle high-five or wave goodbye while you say: "When we have a problem, we can use kind words and find a solution. Bunny and Bear are so proud of you for helping them solve their problem! You're a good friend."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on the emotional regulation piece — this is developmentally what 2-3 year olds need most. Model and practice the "calm down breath" (the amygdala concept doesn't need to be named, but the practice is real). Demonstrate "I feel sad" statements with the puppets and let the child observe. The goal is not that they implement these techniques immediately, but that they're hearing the language. Use *empathy* by name: "Bear feels sad. Bunny sees that Bear is sad. That's called empathy — noticing how someone else feels."

**3-4+ years**:
Practice "I" statements together actively: present a conflict scenario and ask "How could Bunny say that with an 'I' statement instead of a 'you' statement?" Introduce the interests-vs-positions concept explicitly with the orange example: "They both said they wanted the orange, but actually they wanted *different things* from the orange! What's the real reason you want something? That's your interest." Let the child invent and act out both the conflict and resolution with full puppet voices.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Photo Scenarios**: Use picture cards showing common conflicts (two children reaching for a toy, children bumping into each other, etc.). Show each picture and ask: "What's happening? What could they do?" Act out the solution with puppets.

**Variation 2 - Mirror Emotions**: Use the puppets to show different feelings during conflict. Start with angry/sad puppets, then show them becoming calm and happy as they solve the problem. Ask: "How did they feel when they had a problem? How do they feel now?"

**Repeat play**: Change the contested item each time (ball, book, tricycle, etc.) or introduce different character combinations. Familiar scenarios help children internalize the problem-solving process and feel confident using these skills in real life.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated or upset when watching the puppets' conflict and doesn't understand it's play-acting.

**Solution**: Pause and reassure the child: "It's okay, this is pretend. Bunny and Bear are just playing. Watch—now they're going to fix their problem and be happy again." Show the puppets hugging or celebrating the solution. Some children need extra comfort when watching conflict, even pretend ones. You can also frame it as: "The puppets are learning, just like you are!"

**Challenge**: Child has difficulty suggesting solutions or stays quiet during the activity.

**Solution**: Don't force participation. Simply having the child watch and observe is valuable for this age group. You can gently offer a suggestion: "Hmm, I wonder if they could take turns?" and let the child observe the outcome. Over time and with repeated exposure, the child will feel more comfortable contributing ideas.

**Challenge**: Child acts out aggression or shows conflict behavior immediately after the activity.

**Solution**: This is normal and developmental. The activity raises awareness of conflict behavior, which must come before children can learn alternatives. Stay calm, gently redirect: "I see you're upset. Let's use words like the puppets did. What do you need?" Repeat the activity regularly—it takes many exposures for young children to internalize new skills.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Throughout-the-day reinforcement**: When you notice real conflicts between children, pause and use puppet language: "It looks like you both want this toy. What could you do? Could you take turns like the puppets did?"

2. **Practice in role-play**: During other play times, occasionally act out simple problems: "My toy got knocked over—I'm sad! What should I do?" Model using your own words to solve problems.

3. **Connection to daily life**: When reading books together, pause and ask: "Do these characters have a problem? How could they solve it?" This extends the concept beyond the puppets to stories and real situations.
