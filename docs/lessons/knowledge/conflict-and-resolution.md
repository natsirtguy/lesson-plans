# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Conflict and Resolution

## Activity Summary

Children learn that disagreements are normal and that there are helpful ways to solve problems together. Through guided activities, songs, and role-play scenarios, they discover how to use words, take turns, and find solutions where everyone feels better. This lesson builds foundational conflict resolution skills and emotional regulation.

## Vocabulary

**Problem**: A situation where two people want different things or one person has hurt another's feelings. Example: When two children want the same toy, they have a problem that needs solving.

**Compromise**: When two people each give up something small so both can be a little happy. Example: One friend gets the toy first, then the other friend gets it—that's a compromise.

**Solution**: An idea or action that helps fix a problem and makes people feel better. Example: Taking turns with the toy is a solution that helps both children play together.

**Cooperate**: Working together with someone else toward the same goal. Example: When children clean up toys together, they cooperate to finish faster.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: "Wheels on the Bus"

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 8-8-12 syllables per verse):

*Verse 1*
When we have a problem, what do we do?
What do we do?
When we have a problem, what do we do?
We use kind words all day long.

*Verse 2*
We can share and take a turn, take a turn, take a turn.
We can share and take a turn,
That's how friends work out their problems,
And everyone feels better!

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Hold hands up in "problem" shape (palms facing each other, slightly apart) when singing about problems, then bring hands together when singing about solutions
2. Point to mouth when singing "use kind words"
3. Alternate arms in taking-turns motion when singing "take a turn"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will engage in guided role-play and problem-solving scenarios using puppets or stuffed animals to act out common conflicts and discover solutions together. This allows them to safely practice conflict resolution skills in a playful, non-threatening way while building empathy and understanding of different perspectives.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on demonstration with role-play and puppetry

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Two hand puppets or stuffed animals (different types work best—e.g., bunny and bear)
- Simple props: toy block, toy car, or plush ball (something two puppets might "want")
- Open floor space for puppet theater

**Optional**:
- Small cardboard box or fabric as puppet theater background
- Picture cards showing conflict scenarios
- Reward chart or stickers for practicing kind words

**Cost**: Free (using toys you likely have) or under $5 (if purchasing inexpensive puppets)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Select two distinct hand puppets or stuffed animals and familiarize yourself with using them expressively
2. Choose a small toy or prop that will be the "contested item" in the conflict scenario
3. Create a simple staging area (puppet theater can be as simple as sitting behind a blanket draped over a chair)
4. Clear a safe space for the child to move around and potentially join in role-play

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Introduce the two puppets with distinct personalities and voices. Say: "This is Bunny, and this is Bear. Today they're going to help us learn about problems and how to fix them. Sometimes friends disagree—do you ever disagree with your friends? That's okay! Let's watch what Bunny and Bear do when they have a problem."

2. **Exploration - Scenario 1** (5 min):
   **The Conflict**: Have both puppets reach for the same toy.
   - Puppet 1 says: "I want to play with this toy!"
   - Puppet 2 says: "No! I want it!"
   - Exaggerate frustrated movements and voices (but not scary)
   - Ask the child: "Oh no! What's the problem here? Both puppets want the toy. Do you think they're happy?"

3. **Exploration - Scenario 2** (5 min):
   **Finding a Solution**: Continue with the same scenario but show a solution.
   - Have Puppet 1 say (with your guidance): "I have a good idea! You play with it first, then it's my turn. That's called taking turns!"
   - Have Puppet 2 respond happily: "Yes! I like that idea! You go first, Bunny!"
   - Show them playing together, passing the toy back and forth
   - Ask the child: "Now are they happy? What did they do? They took turns! That's a solution."

4. **Guided Practice** (3-4 min):
   Create a second simple scenario with the child's input:
   - "Bunny wants to build with blocks. Bear wants to build too. What could they do?"
   - Guide the child to suggest solutions (sharing blocks, building together, taking turns)
   - Have the puppets act out the child's suggestion
   - Celebrate: "You found a great solution!"

5. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Have both puppets give the child a gentle high-five or wave goodbye while you say: "When we have a problem, we can use kind words and find a solution. Bunny and Bear are so proud of you for helping them solve their problem! You're a good friend."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Keep scenarios very simple (only 2 characters, 1 toy, basic conflict)
- Use shorter puppet dialogue—just 2-3 words per puppet
- Focus on watching and observing rather than requiring active suggestions
- Repeat the same scenario 2-3 times with slight variations
- Emphasize the puppets' happy emotions when they solve the problem
- Avoid complex problem-solving steps; show direct solutions (sharing, taking turns)

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce 2-3 different conflict scenarios in one session
- Ask open-ended questions: "What else could they try?" "How does Bear feel now?"
- Invite the child to voice one of the puppets with your support
- Add more nuanced solutions: compromise, waiting, playing together, trading
- Ask reflection questions: "Have you ever had a problem like this? What did you do?"
- Introduce the idea that solutions make everyone feel better
- Encourage the child to create their own conflict scenario with puppets

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Photo Scenarios**: Use picture cards showing common conflicts (two children reaching for a toy, children bumping into each other, etc.). Show each picture and ask: "What's happening? What could they do?" Act out the solution with puppets.

**Variation 2 - Mirror Emotions**: Use the puppets to show different feelings during conflict. Start with angry/sad puppets, then show them becoming calm and happy as they solve the problem. Ask: "How did they feel when they had a problem? How do they feel now?"

**Repeat play**: Change the contested item each time (ball, book, tricycle, etc.) or introduce different character combinations. Familiar scenarios help children internalize the problem-solving process and feel confident using these skills in real life.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated or upset when watching the puppets' conflict and doesn't understand it's play-acting.

**Solution**: Pause and reassure the child: "It's okay, this is pretend. Bunny and Bear are just playing. Watch—now they're going to fix their problem and be happy again." Show the puppets hugging or celebrating the solution. Some children need extra comfort when watching conflict, even pretend ones. You can also frame it as: "The puppets are learning, just like you are!"

**Challenge**: Child has difficulty suggesting solutions or stays quiet during the activity.

**Solution**: Don't force participation. Simply having the child watch and observe is valuable for this age group. You can gently offer a suggestion: "Hmm, I wonder if they could take turns?" and let the child observe the outcome. Over time and with repeated exposure, the child will feel more comfortable contributing ideas.

**Challenge**: Child acts out aggression or shows conflict behavior immediately after the activity.

**Solution**: This is normal and developmental. The activity raises awareness of conflict behavior, which must come before children can learn alternatives. Stay calm, gently redirect: "I see you're upset. Let's use words like the puppets did. What do you need?" Repeat the activity regularly—it takes many exposures for young children to internalize new skills.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Throughout-the-day reinforcement**: When you notice real conflicts between children, pause and use puppet language: "It looks like you both want this toy. What could you do? Could you take turns like the puppets did?"

2. **Practice in role-play**: During other play times, occasionally act out simple problems: "My toy got knocked over—I'm sad! What should I do?" Model using your own words to solve problems.

3. **Connection to daily life**: When reading books together, pause and ask: "Do these characters have a problem? How could they solve it?" This extends the concept beyond the puppets to stories and real situations.
