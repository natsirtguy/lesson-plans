# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Conflict Resolution Role-Play

## Activity Summary

Children practice peaceful problem-solving by acting out common conflicts (like sharing disagreements, toy disputes, or friendship misunderstandings) and trying different solutions. Through guided role-play, children learn to recognize conflicts, understand different perspectives, and develop skills for resolving problems without hitting or yelling. This activity builds empathy and confidence in handling real-life disagreements in a safe, playful environment.

## Vocabulary

**Empathy**: Understanding and sharing how someone else feels; imagining what it's like to be in their shoes. When your friend feels sad because you took their toy, empathy means recognizing that sad feeling and caring about it.

**Peaceful**: Calm and free from fighting or meanness; solving problems with words instead of actions. When two friends use calm words to decide who gets the toy first, they are being peaceful.

**Compromise**: Finding a solution where both people get something they want or need, even if it's not exactly what they hoped for. Instead of one person getting the toy, you might compromise by taking turns or playing together.

**Communicate**: Sharing your thoughts and feelings with words so others understand what you need or feel. When you tell a friend "I'm sad" or "I want a turn," you are communicating.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children watch you model a conflict scenario, then practice acting out conflicts and solutions together. Through role-play, they learn concrete problem-solving steps: naming the problem, identifying feelings, brainstorming solutions, and trying them out. The safe pretend environment lets children practice skills before using them in real disagreements.

**Activity Type**: Social-Emotional Learning / Interpersonal Practice

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes (depending on number of scenarios)

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Open floor space (at least 8 x 8 feet)
- Simple props related to conflicts (two stuffed animals, toy cars, blocks, or other items children might dispute over)

**Optional**:
- Puppets or stuffed animals for acting
- Picture cards showing different emotions
- Conflict resolution visual chart (showing: "Stop, Breathe, Talk, Solve")
- Timer to keep scenarios brief and focused
- Comfort items or calm-down corner for children who find role-play challenging

**Cost**: Free to under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose 2-3 realistic conflict scenarios the child has experienced (sharing a toy, someone said something mean, accidentally knocked something over)
2. Gather simple props that represent the conflicts
3. Create a calm, quiet space designated for role-play
4. Plan what role you'll play and what role the child will play
5. Check that floor space is clear and safe for movement

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (3-4 minutes):
   Explain: "Today we're going to practice what to do when friends disagree or can't share. Disagreements happen to everyone, and there are ways to solve them. We're going to act out some situations, kind of like a play, so we can practice what to do when real disagreements happen. Remember, during our practice, we use gentle voices and bodies—no real hitting or yelling, even in pretend."

2. **Exploration** (10-15 minutes):
   Start with a simple scenario (like two people wanting the same toy). You and the child act it out:
   - Model the conflict: "I really want this toy!"
   - Stop the action and ask: "What's the problem here?"
   - Guide solutions: "What could we do instead of fighting? We could take turns, play together, or find another toy."
   - Act out the solution together
   - Then present another scenario for the child to practice: "Let's pretend we both want this toy. Show me what you could do or say."
   - Give choices if needed, but let the child lead the solution
   - If the child defaults to hitting or yelling, gently redirect: "In our practice, we use words instead. What could you say?"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   After each scenario, ask:
   - "What was the problem in that story?"
   - "How did the character feel?"
   - "What did they do to solve it?"
   - "Have you ever had this problem?"
   - "What could you do if this happens to you?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   Bring everyone back together and say: "You did such a good job practicing how to solve problems! Today we learned that we can use our words and ask for help when we disagree. Everyone has disagreements sometimes. Now you know what to do. I'm so proud of how you're learning to solve problems!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep scenarios very simple and concrete (just sharing a toy or taking a turn). Use puppets or stuffed animals more than having the child act themselves. Repeat the same scenario several times—children learn through repetition. Don't expect the child to generate solutions; guide them to specific options like "take turns" or "play together." Focus more on naming feelings ("You're upset!") than on elaborate problem-solving. Accept simpler solutions and provide lots of positive modeling. Expect this to take 15-20 minutes with high adult support.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce more complex scenarios (someone left you out, someone took your turn, you disagree about the rules). Ask children to generate their own solutions rather than offering choices. Discuss why characters did things: "Why do you think they did that?" Ask children to think about the other person: "How do you think your friend felt?" Have children role-play multiple solutions to the same problem. Create scenarios based on actual conflicts they've experienced. Let children in pairs role-play with minimal adult involvement. Introduce problem-solving steps in order: "First we use our words, then we listen, then we find a solution." Discuss what to do when first solutions don't work.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Real Conflict Re-Play—When actual conflicts happen, role-play how to handle them better. "Let's practice what you could do instead. Want to show me?" This connects learning directly to real life.

**Variation 2**: Children Lead Role-Play—Have older children act out scenarios and lead younger ones in solutions. This deepens their own learning and builds confidence.

**Variation 3**: Create a Problem-Solving Comic—Draw simple pictures of a problem and solution, creating a visual story about resolving conflict. Builds memory and literacy.

**Variation 4**: Feelings Role-Play—Act out scenarios about big emotions (being left out, being scared, feeling frustrated). This builds emotional vocabulary and regulation.

**Variation 5**: Community Role-Play—Expand to bigger contexts (what to do if someone cuts in line, how to include everyone in a game, how to help a friend who's sad).

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child gets upset or emotional during conflict role-play.

**Solution**: Stop immediately and provide comfort. Let them know it's just pretend. Switch to using puppets or animals instead of people. Scale back to simpler, less emotionally-charged scenarios. Some children need to observe more before participating. It's okay if they're not ready—emotions matter more than completing the activity.

**Challenge**: Child defaults to hitting or yelling rather than using words.

**Solution**: Gently pause and redirect: "In our practice, we use words instead. What could you say?" Model the language: "You could say, 'I want a turn' or 'I don't like that.'" Role-play it again with the child using words. Celebrate heavily when they succeed. Expect this to take many repetitions—it's new learning.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand role-play as pretend; treats it as real.

**Solution**: Use puppets or animals instead—it's easier to understand that animals are pretending. Keep saying "Let's pretend..." or "In our play story..." Use obvious pretend elements like silly voices or exaggerated movements. Don't push if the child isn't developmentally ready. This skill develops over time.

**Challenge**: Role-play feels forced or the child resists.

**Solution**: Let them observe several times before expecting participation. Observation is valid learning. Use storytelling instead of acting: "Let's talk about what happened in our story and what they could do." Some children learn better through discussion than through dramatic reenactment.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Document Growth**: Keep notes on conflicts the child handles better over time. When the child successfully uses a conflict resolution strategy in real life, celebrate enthusiastically and remind them: "Remember when we practiced this?"

2. **Create a Problem-Solving Reference**: Draw or write the strategies you've practiced together and refer back to them when real conflicts happen. Build a problem-solving toolkit so children recognize their growing skills.

3. **Share and Extend**: If the child is in group care, let teachers and caregivers know what strategies you're practicing at home so they can reinforce the same approaches.
