# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Conflict Resolution Role-Play

## Activity Summary

Children practice peaceful problem-solving by acting out common conflicts (like sharing disagreements, toy disputes, or friendship misunderstandings) and trying different solutions. Through guided role-play, children learn to recognize conflicts, understand different perspectives, and develop skills for resolving problems without hitting or yelling. This activity builds empathy and confidence in handling real-life disagreements in a safe, playful environment.

## Vocabulary

**Amygdala**: A small, almond-shaped structure deep inside your brain that acts as an alarm system. When you feel threatened — someone grabs your toy, says something mean — your amygdala fires and triggers the *fight-or-flight response*: your heart speeds up, your muscles tense, and you feel a surge of anger or fear. This happens *before* your thinking brain can evaluate the situation, which is why children (and adults) sometimes react with hitting or yelling before they think.

**Prefrontal Cortex**: The front part of your brain, right behind your forehead, responsible for planning, decision-making, and impulse control. When you *stop and think* before reacting, that's your prefrontal cortex overriding your amygdala. In young children, the prefrontal cortex is still developing (it doesn't fully mature until around age 25!), which is a biological reason why managing emotions is genuinely harder for children than for adults.

**Negotiation**: A structured process where two people with different wants try to find a solution that works for both. Real negotiation involves *stating your position* ("I want the toy"), *understanding the other person's position* ("You want it too"), and *generating options* ("We could take turns, share, or find another toy"). Diplomats, lawyers, and business people use negotiation every day — it's one of the most important skills in human society.

**Perspective-Taking**: The cognitive ability to understand a situation from someone else's point of view — what they see, feel, and want. This is related to *theory of mind* (understanding that others have different thoughts than you). Perspective-taking requires your brain to temporarily suppress your own viewpoint and simulate another person's experience — a demanding cognitive task that develops between ages 3 and 7.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Are You Sleeping (Frère Jacques)

**Tempo**: Slow and gentle

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
When we're fighting, when we're fighting,
What's the way, what's the way?
Use our words now, use our words now,
Let's talk today, let's talk today.

*Verse 2*
Can we share it, can we share it?
Take a turn, take a turn.
Help each other, help each other,
Friends return, friends return.

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Put hands together in talking motion during "use our words now" and "let's talk today"
2. Pretend to take something with both hands during "take a turn" and alternate left hand/right hand
3. Put arms around yourself in a hug during "help each other" and "friends return"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children watch you model a conflict scenario, then practice acting out conflicts and solutions together. Through role-play, they learn concrete problem-solving steps: naming the problem, identifying feelings, brainstorming solutions, and trying them out. The safe pretend environment lets children practice skills before using them in real disagreements.

**Activity Type**: Social-Emotional Learning / Interpersonal Practice

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes (depending on number of scenarios)

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Open floor space (at least 8 x 8 feet)
- Simple props related to conflicts (two stuffed animals, toy cars, blocks, or other items children might dispute over)

**Optional**:
- Puppets or stuffed animals for acting
- Picture cards showing different emotions
- Conflict resolution visual chart (showing: "Stop, Breathe, Talk, Solve")
- Timer to keep scenarios brief and focused
- Comfort items or calm-down corner for children who find role-play challenging

**Cost**: Free to under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose 2-3 realistic conflict scenarios the child has experienced (sharing a toy, someone said something mean, accidentally knocked something over)
2. Gather simple props that represent the conflicts
3. Create a calm, quiet space designated for role-play
4. Plan what role you'll play and what role the child will play
5. Check that floor space is clear and safe for movement

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (3-4 minutes):
   Explain the brain science of conflict: "When someone grabs your toy, a tiny part of your brain called the *amygdala* fires an alarm — DANGER! Your heart speeds up, your muscles get tight, and you feel like hitting or yelling. That's called the *fight-or-flight response* — it's your brain trying to protect you, just like it protected cave people from lions. But here's the thing: a toy dispute isn't a lion. The *prefrontal cortex* — the thinking part right behind your forehead — can tell the amygdala 'calm down, this isn't dangerous, let me handle it.' Today we're going to practice letting our prefrontal cortex take charge."

2. **Exploration** (10-15 minutes):
   Start with a scenario (two people want the same toy). Act it out, then freeze:
   - "What just happened in your brain? Your *amygdala* fired — you felt angry. Now let's activate the *prefrontal cortex*. Take a deep breath — that actually sends a signal to your amygdala to stand down."
   - Teach *negotiation* steps: "Step 1: State your position — 'I want the toy.' Step 2: *Perspective-taking* — ask what THEY want and why. 'What do you want? Why?' Step 3: Generate options — 'We could take turns, play together, or find two toys.' Step 3 is where you find a solution that works for both."
   - Practice the full negotiation sequence. When the child defaults to grabbing or yelling: "That's your *amygdala* talking — it reacted before your *prefrontal cortex* could think. Let's try again: deep breath first, then use the negotiation steps."

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   After each scenario, analyze the brain science:
   - "What did your amygdala want you to do?" (Hit, grab, yell)
   - "What did your prefrontal cortex help you do instead?" (Talk, negotiate, compromise)
   - Practice *perspective-taking*: "Now pretend you're the other person. How did THEY feel? What did THEY want? This is hard because your brain has to temporarily stop thinking about what YOU want and imagine being someone else."
   - "Every time you practice this, the connections between your prefrontal cortex and your amygdala get stronger — it gets easier to stay calm during real conflicts."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   Summarize: "Today you practiced the most important brain skill there is: letting your *prefrontal cortex* override your *amygdala*. You practiced *negotiation* — stating positions, *perspective-taking*, and generating solutions. These are the same skills that diplomats use to prevent wars and that business people use every day. And every time you practice, those neural pathways get stronger."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep scenarios simple (one toy, two people). Use puppets — it's easier for children to identify brain processes in characters than themselves. Name the brain parts with every scenario: "Teddy's *amygdala* just fired — he feels angry! Can we help Teddy's *prefrontal cortex* take over?" At this age, *perspective-taking* is just emerging, so model it explicitly: "Teddy wants the ball. Bunny wants the ball too. They want the SAME thing — that's why there's a conflict." Focus on the deep-breath-first habit — this physiologically activates the parasympathetic nervous system and gives the prefrontal cortex time to engage. 15-20 minutes with high adult support.

**3-4+ years**:
Full *negotiation* practice with multi-step conflicts. Teach *perspective-taking* as a formal exercise: "Before you respond, tell me what the OTHER person is thinking and feeling." This is cognitively demanding — praise the effort. Introduce the concept of *win-win* vs. *win-lose* outcomes: "A compromise where both people get something is called *win-win*. When only one person gets what they want, that's *win-lose* — and it usually creates MORE conflict later." Discuss the biology: "Your *prefrontal cortex* won't be fully developed until you're about 25 years old — that's why managing emotions is genuinely hard right now. Every time you practice, you're building those neural connections ahead of schedule." Create scenarios based on real conflicts and have children practice generating multiple solutions before choosing one.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Real Conflict Re-Play—When actual conflicts happen, role-play how to handle them better. "Let's practice what you could do instead. Want to show me?" This connects learning directly to real life.

**Variation 2**: Children Lead Role-Play—Have older children act out scenarios and lead younger ones in solutions. This deepens their own learning and builds confidence.

**Variation 3**: Create a Problem-Solving Comic—Draw simple pictures of a problem and solution, creating a visual story about resolving conflict. Builds memory and literacy.

**Variation 4**: Feelings Role-Play—Act out scenarios about big emotions (being left out, being scared, feeling frustrated). This builds emotional vocabulary and regulation.

**Variation 5**: Community Role-Play—Expand to bigger contexts (what to do if someone cuts in line, how to include everyone in a game, how to help a friend who's sad).

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child gets upset or emotional during conflict role-play.

**Solution**: Stop immediately and provide comfort. Let them know it's just pretend. Switch to using puppets or animals instead of people. Scale back to simpler, less emotionally-charged scenarios. Some children need to observe more before participating. It's okay if they're not ready—emotions matter more than completing the activity.

**Challenge**: Child defaults to hitting or yelling rather than using words.

**Solution**: Gently pause and redirect: "In our practice, we use words instead. What could you say?" Model the language: "You could say, 'I want a turn' or 'I don't like that.'" Role-play it again with the child using words. Celebrate heavily when they succeed. Expect this to take many repetitions—it's new learning.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand role-play as pretend; treats it as real.

**Solution**: Use puppets or animals instead—it's easier to understand that animals are pretending. Keep saying "Let's pretend..." or "In our play story..." Use obvious pretend elements like silly voices or exaggerated movements. Don't push if the child isn't developmentally ready. This skill develops over time.

**Challenge**: Role-play feels forced or the child resists.

**Solution**: Let them observe several times before expecting participation. Observation is valid learning. Use storytelling instead of acting: "Let's talk about what happened in our story and what they could do." Some children learn better through discussion than through dramatic reenactment.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Document Growth**: Keep notes on conflicts the child handles better over time. When the child successfully uses a conflict resolution strategy in real life, celebrate enthusiastically and remind them: "Remember when we practiced this?"

2. **Create a Problem-Solving Reference**: Draw or write the strategies you've practiced together and refer back to them when real conflicts happen. Build a problem-solving toolkit so children recognize their growing skills.

3. **Share and Extend**: If the child is in group care, let teachers and caregivers know what strategies you're practicing at home so they can reinforce the same approaches.
