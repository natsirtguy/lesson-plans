# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Customer Service Role-Play

## 🎯 Activity Summary

In this activity, children pretend to be shopkeepers, cashiers, servers, or service workers helping customers make purchases or get assistance. This imaginative play builds social skills, communication, and understanding of community roles while developing important interaction patterns like greeting, listening, and problem-solving.

## Vocabulary

**Transaction**: The process of exchanging money for goods or services. When you go to a shop, give the shopkeeper money, and receive something in return, that's a transaction—you both give something and get something.

**Customer Service**: Helping people who want to buy something or need assistance. A customer service worker listens carefully to what someone needs, finds a solution, and treats them with kindness and respect.

**Shopkeeper**: A person who runs a shop or store and sells items to customers. The shopkeeper greets people, shows them what's available, takes their money, and makes sure they have a good experience.

**Commerce**: The buying and selling of goods and services between people. Commerce is how communities work together—one person makes or grows something, another person buys it, and both benefit.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore the roles of shopkeeper and customer through imaginative role-play. This activity develops vocabulary, social skills, turn-taking, listening, and understanding of how commerce works in their community. Children practice real-world communication patterns: greeting, asking questions, making decisions, exchanging money, and saying thank you.

**Activity Type**: Role-playing and simulation / Social interaction / Imaginative play

**Duration**: 20-40 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Toy cash register or DIY version (decorated box works great)
- Play money (paper bills and plastic coins)
- Items to "sell" (8-12 toys, plastic food, dolls, books, or stuffed animals)
- Shopping basket or bag

**Optional**:
- Simple name tags or aprons to define roles
- Toy receipt pad and pencil
- Dress-up items (hat, glasses, vest)
- Price tags or labels
- Toy shopping cart
- Menu or sign for the "business"
- Shopping list (pictures or words)

**Cost**: Free to $5 (most materials can be household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather play items and arrange them in a display (shelf, table, or lined-up space)
2. Set up the "shop" area using a table, bench, or low surface as a counter
3. Create space where customers can browse and a separate area for transactions
4. Test play money to ensure pieces are safe and age-appropriate

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (3-4 minutes):
   Introduce the concept: "Look! We have a store today. You can be the shopkeeper—the person who sells things—or the customer—the person who comes to buy something." Point out specific items available and model one simple transaction. Show how the cash register works (or how to pretend with a box). Explain: "Money is pretend—we use it in our game. The shopkeeper helps the customer find what they want."

2. **Exploration & Role Introduction** (5-7 minutes):
   Let children browse the shop items and handle the play money. Show them how the register works. Invite a child to be the first shopkeeper while you're the customer, or vice versa. Keep your demonstration simple and enthusiastic. Notice which children are drawn to which role and allow flexibility. Comment positively: "You're looking at all the items—what caught your eye?" or "Great job putting that in the register!"

3. **Guided Play with Modeling** (5-10 minutes):
   Participate in 2-3 transactions to show expected interactions. Demonstrate:
   - Greeting: "Hello! Welcome to our shop!"
   - Showing interest: "What would you like today?"
   - Completing transaction: Taking money, providing item
   - Thanking: "Thank you for shopping with us!"

   Ask guiding questions: "What would the shopkeeper say when someone walks in?" "How much does this cost?" "What should we do after we give them the money?" "Want to switch jobs and be the shopkeeper?"

4. **Extended Role-Play** (remaining time):
   Step back and let children direct the play. If energy flags, introduce a new "customer," suggest new scenarios ("What if the customer wants to buy two things?"), add a new role ("Someone is delivering boxes to the shop"), or expand: "We're opening a new store!" Allow role-switching as interest shifts. Watch for repetition and comfort—children may do the same transaction many times, which builds confidence. Be responsive rather than directive; ask open-ended questions and validate both roles equally.

5. **Wrap-Up** (3-5 minutes):
   Give a gentle warning: "We'll be cleaning up in a few minutes." Offer a final round of play if energy is high. Signal the end: "It's time to close the shop for today." Ask a reflection question: "What did you like about being a shopkeeper/customer?" or "What did your shop sell?" Make cleanup part of the play: "Let's put everything back so it's ready tomorrow." Invite children to help with specific tasks: "Can you collect all the play money?" Praise participation.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep transactions simple with fewer items to choose from (4-6 items). Mostly you play the shopkeeper while the child is the customer. Use very brief, repetitive interactions ("Here you go!" "Thank you!"). Stick to concrete, familiar items (toy food, dolls). Allow lots of sensory exploration—holding items, handling money. Accept that some children may just want to carry a basket without completing purchases. Duration: 10-15 minutes. Provide high adult support; you'll model most transactions and gently coach vocabulary.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce multiple transaction types: paying with exact change, counting change, dealing with "sold out" items. Add communication challenges: "What if the customer can't find what they want?" Include peer-to-peer role-play with minimal adult direction. Introduce new scenarios: restaurant server, doctor's office receptionist, library checkout, gas station attendant, ticket booth. Add price negotiation or special deals. Combine with other play: "We need to buy food for our picnic." Introduce written elements: shopping lists, price tags, receipts, business signs. Duration: 25-40 minutes. Children can sustain longer, deeper play.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Restaurant Role-Play**
Transform the shop into a cafe or restaurant where children order food, receive items on a tray, and pay. Adds the server role and dining experience.

**Variation 2: Doctor's Office or Veterinary Clinic**
The shopkeeper becomes a medical professional; items become "medicines" or "treatments." Introduces healthcare roles and vocabulary while maintaining the transaction structure.

**Variation 3: Library Checkout**
Children borrow books from a librarian, return items, and receive "due date" cards. Focuses on community helpers and managing collections.

**Variation 4: Grocery Store with Shopping List**
Provide picture/word shopping lists so customers search for specific items. Introduces literacy and intentional shopping.

**Variation 5: Bakery or Pizza Shop**
Combine with play dough or simple craft items to "make" items that are then "sold." Adds creative production to the service experience.

**Repeat play**: The real value is in returning to this activity again and again, building deeper skills each time. Use successful scenarios as inspiration for new variations.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't play shopkeeper, only wants to be customer
**Solution**: Don't force role-switching. Let them be customer as long as they're engaged. Model the shopkeeper role enthusiastically so they see it's fun. Gradually offer: "Want to try selling for just one customer?" with heavy adult support. Respect that some children need more time building confidence in helper roles.

**Challenge**: Child becomes overly controlling or bossy as shopkeeper
**Solution**: Validate the role: "You're the shopkeeper—you get to decide things." Redirect the tone while keeping the role: "Your customers want to feel welcomed. Let's say that in a friendly way." Model respectful authority: "You can run your shop and be kind to customers." If behavior becomes unkind, pause and try again or suggest a role change.

**Challenge**: Play gets chaotic—money scattered, items everywhere, children running around
**Solution**: Simplify the setup with fewer items and a smaller play area. Add structure: "Money goes in the register, items stay on the shelf until someone buys them." Slow it down by doing one transaction at a time. Use physical boundaries: "Our shop is just this table." Reduce group size to individuals or pairs. Reset midway if needed.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand the transaction concept
**Solution**: Make it concrete and repetitive—do the same simple transaction many times. Skip the money concept initially and just practice: "You're the shopkeeper, I'm the customer, what will you sell me?" Use real items they value. Combine with context: "We need food for the party." Celebrate the exchange to make it feel special.

**Challenge**: Conflict over items—both children want the same thing
**Solution**: Have multiples of popular items when possible. Coach negotiation: "That's popular—can we make two available?" Redirect: "If something sells out, we can tell customers it will be back soon." Use this as a teaching moment for social learning, not a conflict to eliminate.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Create a themed shop**: Set up variations like a bakery, pet store, flower shop, or bookstore to explore different community services and vocabulary
2. **Add writing practice**: Introduce receipts, shopping lists, price tags, and business signs to incorporate early literacy skills
3. **Expand with new roles**: Try server, librarian, doctor, or delivery person to explore diverse community helpers and their responsibilities
4. **Combine with other learning**: Use the shop to explore categories ("We're selling toys today"), colors, numbers, and social skills in a meaningful context
5. **Take it outside**: Transform your shop into a food stand, ticket booth, or garden market to change the environment and keep play fresh
