# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Debate and Discussion Games

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces young children to the foundations of rhetoric and argumentation — the art of making a claim, supporting it with evidence, and listening to counterarguments. Through playful debate games, children practice constructing arguments (not just stating preferences), identifying reasons and evidence for their positions, and engaging with opposing viewpoints. These are the building blocks of logical reasoning and persuasive communication.

## Vocabulary

**Claim**: A statement about what you think or believe — your position on a question. When you say "strawberries are the best fruit," that's a claim. In rhetoric (the art of speaking persuasively), every good argument starts with a clear claim.

**Evidence**: The reasons or facts you give to support your claim. If your claim is "strawberries are the best," your evidence might be "because they're sweet and red and I can pick them myself." Evidence is what makes an argument strong — without evidence, a claim is just a feeling.

**Counterargument**: When someone gives a reason why your claim might not be right, or offers a different claim with their own evidence. If you say "dogs are the best pets" and your friend says "but cats are quieter and easier to care for," that's a counterargument. Good thinkers listen to counterarguments and think about them.

**Rhetoric**: The art of using words to share your ideas in a way that helps others understand your thinking. When you explain WHY you believe something instead of just saying what you believe, you're practicing rhetoric — you're being persuasive, which means helping someone see your point of view.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Row, Row, Row Your Boat

**Tempo**: Moderate and conversational

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Make your claim out clear and strong
Share your evidence along
If your friend says something new
That's a counterargument too

*Verse 2*
Rhetoric means saying why
Not just what, but how and why
Listen to the other side
Think about it — open wide

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Hold up one finger firmly on "claim" to show a strong position
2. Count on fingers for "evidence" to show listing reasons
3. Cup hand to ear on "listen to the other side" and tap forehead on "think about it"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

In this activity, children practice the real structure of argumentation: making a claim, providing evidence to support it, hearing counterarguments, and responding. Through playful debates about engaging choices (like "Which is the best fruit?"), children learn that a strong argument isn't just saying what you like — it requires reasons. They practice rhetoric (the art of persuasion) and discover that disagreement isn't conflict; it's how good thinkers sharpen their ideas.

**Activity Type**: Structured argumentation game with claim-evidence practice

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Chart paper or whiteboard (or just paper)
- Markers in different colors
- Picture cards or actual objects representing different choices (fruit, animals, colors, toys)
- Open space to sit in a circle

**Optional**:
- Stickers or stamps for "voting"
- Puppet or stuffed animal as a "discussion leader"
- Simple bell or chime to signal turn-taking

**Cost**: Free (using household items) to under $5 if purchasing picture cards

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather picture cards or objects representing 2-3 clear choices (strawberries vs. blueberries, dogs vs. cats, red vs. blue, etc.)
2. Arrange seating in a circle so all children can see each other and hear clearly
3. Write category titles on paper/whiteboard (e.g., "Favorite Fruit," "Favorite Animal") if you want to track responses
4. Model calm, respectful tone—you'll be demonstrating this throughout the activity

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Sit together in a circle
   - Say: "Today we're going to play a discussion game! We'll talk about what we like, listen to each other's ideas, and learn that it's okay if we like different things."
   - Show the first two picture options (e.g., strawberries and blueberries)
   - Explain the game: "I'm going to ask a question, and everyone gets a turn to say their answer. Then we'll listen to each other with kind ears."

2. **Exploration** (10-12 min):
   - **Round 1 - Making Claims**:
     - Ask: "Which is the best fruit — strawberries or blueberries?"
     - Point to each picture as you say it slowly
     - Go around the circle: each child points to or says their choice
     - Name what they're doing: "You just made a claim! Your claim is that strawberries are the best. A claim is what you believe about a question."
     - Point out different claims: "Maya claims strawberries are best. Lucas claims blueberries. They have different claims — and that's what makes a debate interesting!"

   - **Round 2 - Adding Evidence**:
     - Return to their claims, but now ask: "WHY do you think strawberries are best? Give me your evidence — your reasons."
     - Accept simple answers: "It's red!" "It's sweet!" "I don't know!"
     - Name and validate their evidence: "Your evidence is that strawberries are sweet. That's a reason that supports your claim!"
     - Model the structure explicitly: "My claim is that blueberries are best. My evidence is that they're small enough to eat a whole handful at once. See how I said my claim AND my evidence?"
     - This teaches children the fundamental structure of an argument: claim + evidence

   - **Round 3 - Counterarguments (Optional)**:
     - Now introduce counterarguments: "Maya says strawberries are best because they're sweet. Does anyone have a counterargument — a reason why that might not be right, or why blueberries might be even better?"
     - Guide gently: "A counterargument is when you hear someone's reason and say 'but what about THIS?' Lucas, can you think of a counterargument?"
     - Frame it positively: "We're not being mean — we're doing what real debaters do! They listen to each other's evidence and think about whether it's strong. That's rhetoric — the art of persuading people with your words."
     - Model a counterargument yourself: "Maya says strawberries are sweet — but Lucas could say blueberries are sweet TOO, so sweetness doesn't prove strawberries are best. That's a strong counterargument!"
     - Celebrate the thinking: "You're practicing rhetoric right now. You're thinking about WHY, not just WHAT."

3. **Discovery** (2-3 min):
   - Ask reflection questions using the real terms:
     - "What was your claim today? What evidence did you give?"
     - "Did you hear a counterargument — a reason someone disagreed with you? What was it?"
     - "Did anyone's evidence make you think differently about your claim?"
     - "Who can remember what [child]'s evidence was?" — this reinforces listening and the structure of arguments
   - Summarize: "Today we practiced rhetoric — the art of explaining WHY we think something, not just WHAT we think. A claim without evidence is weak. But a claim with good evidence is persuasive!"

4. **Wrap-up** (1-2 min):
   - Celebrate: "You all did a wonderful job discussing and listening to each other today!"
   - Sing a line from the song: "Say your ideas, do agree—both your thoughts have room for me!"
   - Transition to next activity: "Great listeners and talkers like you are so smart!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use only **two very clear visual choices** (real objects are better than pictures at this age — actual strawberries and blueberries, or toy dogs and cats)
- Focus on the **claim** stage: "Which one do you pick? That's your claim!" One-word answers are fine
- Model evidence yourself: "I pick the dog. My evidence is that dogs are soft. See? Claim, then evidence."
- Use a puppet or stuffed animal to model making claims and giving evidence — this keeps 2-year-olds engaged
- Don't expect counterarguments yet — just build the habit of saying WHY, not just WHAT
- Still use the real words — "claim," "evidence" — alongside simple language. Say "your claim — that means what you pick" every time
- **Simplest version**: Point to a choice and ask "Why that one?" Even if they can't answer, you're planting the idea that reasons matter

**3-4+ years**:
- Practice the **full argument structure**: claim, evidence, counterargument
- Ask **"Why?" questions** and expect children to provide at least one piece of evidence
- Introduce **counterarguments** explicitly: "Marcus says dogs are best because they play fetch. Can anyone think of a counterargument — a reason why cats might be better?"
- Play **multiple rounds** with increasing sophistication, moving from preferences to more interesting questions ("Should we play inside or outside? Give your evidence!")
- Introduce the idea of **strong vs. weak evidence**: "You said you like red because it's red — that doesn't tell us WHY. Can you think of a stronger reason?"
- Practice **responding to counterarguments**: "Marcus gave a counterargument. What do you say back? Do you have more evidence?"
- Introduce **voting tallies** after debates: "Let's see if the evidence changed anyone's mind. Who changed their claim after hearing counterarguments?"
- Discuss **rhetoric** as a skill: "You were very persuasive today — that means your evidence was so good it made people think differently!"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Story Argument Analysis**:
Read a simple picture book and pause to identify arguments: "The character wants to go outside. What's their claim? What evidence do they give?" When characters disagree, name the counterarguments. This teaches children to recognize argument structure in narratives, not just in debates.

**Variation 2 - Real-Stakes Persuasion**:
Use the debate structure to make actual decisions: "Should we play outside or inside today? Everyone make a claim and give evidence. Then we'll hear counterarguments." Turn the game into genuine rhetoric — they're trying to persuade the group, and the stakes are real. After the decision, reflect: "Whose evidence was the most persuasive? Why?"

**Variation 3 - Argument Strength Game**:
Present two arguments side by side and ask which is stronger: "Argument 1: We should have apples because I like them. Argument 2: We should have apples because they're crunchy, sweet, and good for our bodies." Ask: "Which argument has more evidence? Which is more persuasive?" This builds critical evaluation skills.

**Repeat Play**:
Change the debate topics daily but maintain the claim-evidence-counterargument structure. Keep a list of debate questions ready, ranging from silly ("Would you rather fly or be invisible? Give your evidence!") to real ("What should we do at the park today?"). The rhetorical structure stays consistent, but new topics maintain engagement and deepen practice.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Children interrupt each other or don't take turns properly
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal at ages 2-3. Use a physical turn-taking object (a special stone, puppet, or ball) that the speaker holds—only the person holding it gets to talk. This makes turn-taking concrete and visual. Practice turn-taking without the debate element first.

**Challenge**: A child gets upset when their choice doesn't "win" or most people disagree with them
**Solution**: Validate their feeling immediately: "Your claim was strong, and your evidence was good!" Reframe: "In real debates, sometimes the best argument doesn't get the most votes. That doesn't mean your evidence was wrong — it means people weighed different things. A good rhetorician learns from every debate and comes back with even stronger evidence next time."

**Challenge**: The child won't participate or won't share their opinion
**Solution**: Never force. Let them observe first. Sometimes children learn by watching. You might ask: "Do you want to listen today and we'll ask you next time?" or offer a non-verbal option "Just point to which one you like" instead of requiring them to speak. Some children need more time before joining discussions.

**Challenge**: Children take the debate "too seriously" or get frustrated
**Solution**: Keep the tone playful and light. Use silly examples ("Would you rather have cereal for shoes or socks for hats?") to show that these aren't serious debates—they're fun conversations. Frame disagreement as exciting, not upsetting: "Oh! We have different ideas! How interesting!"

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Argument Journal**: After each debate, draw or write the claims, evidence, and counterarguments from the session. This builds connections between spoken rhetoric and written argumentation — and shows children that arguments have a visible structure.

2. **Everyday Rhetoric**: Throughout the day, name argument structure when it appears naturally: "You just made a claim that you want the blue cup. What's your evidence? Why the blue one?" This transfers debate skills into real communication.

3. **Evidence Spotting**: When reading books or watching shows, pause and ask: "That character is trying to persuade someone. What claim are they making? What evidence did they give? Is it strong evidence?" This teaches children to analyze rhetoric in the world around them.

4. **Puppet Debates**: Use puppets or stuffed animals to model the full debate structure. One puppet makes a claim with evidence, the other offers a counterargument. Let the child be the judge: "Whose argument was more persuasive? Why?"
