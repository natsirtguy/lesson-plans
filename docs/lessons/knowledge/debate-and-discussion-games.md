# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Debate and Discussion Games

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces young children to the fundamentals of discussion and simple debate through playful games that build listening and speaking skills. Children will practice expressing preferences, taking turns, and respectfully considering different viewpoints in age-appropriate ways that develop communication and social-emotional competencies.

## Vocabulary

**Opinion**: A thought or belief that belongs to you—what you think or like. For example, you might have an opinion that chocolate tastes better than vanilla, and your friend might have a different opinion.

**Discuss**: To talk about something together with someone else, sharing your thoughts back and forth. When you and your friends discuss what game to play, you each say what you like and listen to each other's ideas.

**Agree**: To think or feel the same way as another person about something. If you like carrots AND your friend likes carrots too, you agree—you have the same opinion.

**Respectful**: Treating other people's ideas and feelings with kindness and care, even if you don't agree with them. Being respectful means listening when someone talks and not being mean about different opinions.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 7 syllables each line):

*Verse 1*
I like this but you like that
Some like small and some like fat
We discuss what's right for you
You can say your ideas too
Listen when your friend speaks out
That is what this game's about

*Verse 2*
Say your ideas, do agree
Both your thoughts have room for me
Show respect in what we say
That is how we like to play
Different thoughts make us grow strong
Everyone belongs here, all along

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point to yourself when saying "I like" and point to others when saying "you like"—this reinforces whose idea is being discussed
2. Nod your head slowly during the "listen" and "respect" lines—shows active listening and agreement
3. Open both hands like an open book on "ideas" and "thoughts"—represents sharing and openness to different viewpoints

## Activity

### Activity Overview

In this activity, children play simple discussion and voting games where they express preferences, listen to others' ideas, and make group decisions. Through turn-taking and playful "debates" about silly choices (like "Do you like apples or bananas?"), children develop conversation skills, learn to respect different opinions, and practice the foundational skills of communication and collaborative decision-making.

**Activity Type**: Interactive discussion game with turn-taking and voting

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Chart paper or whiteboard (or just paper)
- Markers in different colors
- Picture cards or actual objects representing different choices (fruit, animals, colors, toys)
- Open space to sit in a circle

**Optional**:
- Stickers or stamps for "voting"
- Puppet or stuffed animal as a "discussion leader"
- Simple bell or chime to signal turn-taking

**Cost**: Free (using household items) to under $5 if purchasing picture cards

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather picture cards or objects representing 2-3 clear choices (strawberries vs. blueberries, dogs vs. cats, red vs. blue, etc.)
2. Arrange seating in a circle so all children can see each other and hear clearly
3. Write category titles on paper/whiteboard (e.g., "Favorite Fruit," "Favorite Animal") if you want to track responses
4. Model calm, respectful tone—you'll be demonstrating this throughout the activity

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Sit together in a circle
   - Say: "Today we're going to play a discussion game! We'll talk about what we like, listen to each other's ideas, and learn that it's okay if we like different things."
   - Show the first two picture options (e.g., strawberries and blueberries)
   - Explain the game: "I'm going to ask a question, and everyone gets a turn to say their answer. Then we'll listen to each other with kind ears."

2. **Exploration** (10-12 min):
   - **Round 1 - Simple Preference Voting**:
     - Ask: "Do you like strawberries or blueberries?"
     - Point to each picture as you say it slowly
     - Go around the circle: each child points to or says their choice
     - You respond to each answer: "Oh! You like strawberries! That's your opinion." or "You like blueberries. I like them too! We agree!"
     - Point out agreements: "Look, Maya and Kiran both like strawberries. They agree!"
     - Point out disagreements positively: "Sophia likes blueberries and Lucas likes strawberries. They have different opinions. That's okay!"

   - **Round 2 - Group Discussion with Reasoning**:
     - Ask the same question again, but this time ask: "Why do you like [choice]?"
     - Accept simple answers: "It's red!" "It's sweet!" "I don't know!"
     - Repeat back what they said: "You like blueberries because they're purple and yummy. That's a good reason!"
     - This teaches children to express reasoning and models active listening

   - **Round 3 - Simple Debate Game (Optional)**:
     - Introduce a "silly choice" question: "If we could only eat ONE fruit, which should it be?"
     - Go around the circle
     - When a child chooses, ask gently: "Does anyone else like [the other choice]?"
     - Frame it playfully: "We have a little friendly disagreement! Some of us like strawberries best and some like blueberries best. Both are great choices!"
     - Explain: "We don't have to agree with everything. We can respectfully have different ideas."
     - Repeat a discussion (not a heated debate—keep it light and fun): "Who wants to tell us why THEIR choice is good?"
     - Model respectful listening: "That's an interesting idea. Thank you for sharing."

3. **Discovery** (2-3 min):
   - Ask reflection questions:
     - "Did you hear someone's idea that was different from yours?" (Yes/no, and name it)
     - "Was it okay that we didn't all agree?" (Yes, because we can have different opinions)
     - "How did it feel to listen to your friends?" (Let them respond)
     - "Who can remember what [child] said they liked?"—this reinforces listening and memory

4. **Wrap-up** (1-2 min):
   - Celebrate: "You all did a wonderful job discussing and listening to each other today!"
   - Sing a line from the song: "Say your ideas, do agree—both your thoughts have room for me!"
   - Transition to next activity: "Great listeners and talkers like you are so smart!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use only **two very clear visual choices** (real objects are better than pictures at this age—actual strawberries and blueberries, or toy dogs and cats)
- Make each round **very short** (just one question per round, 3-4 minutes total)
- Expect simple one-word answers ("Red!" "Dog!")
- Use a puppet or stuffed animal as the "discussion leader" if attention is wandering—this keeps 2-year-olds engaged
- Model the activity more heavily—show what you like first, then ask them to copy or choose
- Don't expect understanding of "disagreement" yet—just build awareness that people can like different things
- **Simplest version**: Just look at two pictures, point to one, and ask "Which one?" Let them point. Celebrate their choice without deep discussion

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce **more complex choices** (three options instead of two, more nuanced topics like "favorite color," "favorite animal," "favorite game")
- Ask **"Why?" questions** and expect longer explanations
- Introduce the concept of "agreement" and "disagreement" explicitly: "Do you agree with Marcus?" (when another child chose differently)
- Play **multiple rounds** with increasing sophistication
- Add the **"silly debate" round** where you gently explore reasons for different opinions
- Introduce **voting tallies**: "Let's count how many people like apples. Let's count how many like bananas."
- Create a **simple graph or tally** on paper to show results visually
- Discuss **why people might like different things**: "Everyone has different favorite things, and that's what makes us special!"
- Introduce more **abstract concepts**: "You disagreed, but you were both respectful. That's called a friendly disagreement."

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Story Discussion Debate**:
Read a simple picture book (like "The Very Hungry Caterpillar") and pause to ask discussion questions: "Should the caterpillar eat more? What do you think happens next?" Let children discuss and share different predictions.

**Variation 2 - Classroom Choice Voting**:
Use the discussion game to make actual decisions: "Should we play outside or inside today?" "Should we read about dinosaurs or space?" Turn the game into something that genuinely matters to the children—they're making a real group decision.

**Repeat Play**:
Change the topics each day to keep it fresh. Keep a list of "discussion questions" ready: fruit preferences, animal preferences, color preferences, activity preferences, silly "what if" questions ("Would you rather have spaghetti for hair or maple syrup for sweat?"). The structure stays the same, but new topics maintain engagement.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Children interrupt each other or don't take turns properly
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal at ages 2-3. Use a physical turn-taking object (a special stone, puppet, or ball) that the speaker holds—only the person holding it gets to talk. This makes turn-taking concrete and visual. Practice turn-taking without the debate element first.

**Challenge**: A child gets upset when their choice doesn't "win" or most people disagree with them
**Solution**: Validate their feeling immediately: "You really like apples! I see that. You have a special opinion about apples that's important." Emphasize that no choice is "wrong" or "bad"—it's just different. Frame it as "We're all different, and that's wonderful. You love apples, and some friends love oranges, and both are yummy!"

**Challenge**: The child won't participate or won't share their opinion
**Solution**: Never force. Let them observe first. Sometimes children learn by watching. You might ask: "Do you want to listen today and we'll ask you next time?" or offer a non-verbal option "Just point to which one you like" instead of requiring them to speak. Some children need more time before joining discussions.

**Challenge**: Children take the debate "too seriously" or get frustrated
**Solution**: Keep the tone playful and light. Use silly examples ("Would you rather have cereal for shoes or socks for hats?") to show that these aren't serious debates—they're fun conversations. Frame disagreement as exciting, not upsetting: "Oh! We have different ideas! How interesting!"

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Discussion Journal**: After each discussion game, draw or write the topic and different opinions. This builds connections between spoken discussion and written/visual representation.

2. **Extend to Decision-Making**: Use discussion games to make real group choices about snack, playtime activities, or story selection. This shows children that their opinions matter and discussions lead to real outcomes.

3. **Practice Respectful Listening**: Throughout the day, point out good listening: "I noticed you listened really well when Marcus was talking!" This reinforces the skills you practiced in the game.

4. **Role-Play Disagreements**: Later in the week, use puppets or stuffed animals to act out friendly disagreements ("I like green. I like blue. We disagree, but we can still be friends!"). This helps solidify the concept.
