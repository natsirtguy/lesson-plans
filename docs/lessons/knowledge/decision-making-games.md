# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Decision-Making Games

## Activity Summary

Decision-making games introduce young children to the real cognitive processes involved in choosing between options: identifying criteria, evaluating trade-offs, predicting outcomes, and experiencing opportunity cost (what you give up when you choose something). Through structured choice games, children practice the same decision-making framework used in fields from economics to engineering — weighing multiple factors, making predictions, and reflecting on whether outcomes matched expectations.

## Vocabulary

**Criteria**: The reasons or rules you use to help you decide. When you pick a snack, your criteria might be "I want something sweet" or "I want something crunchy." Criteria are like a checklist in your brain — they help you evaluate your options. Scientists, engineers, and economists all use criteria when making decisions.

**Trade-off**: When choosing one thing means giving up something else. If you pick the red block, you can't also have the blue block — that's a trade-off. Every decision involves trade-offs because you can't always have everything at once. Understanding trade-offs is a key idea in economics.

**Opportunity Cost**: The thing you didn't get to have or do because you chose something else. If you choose to play with blocks instead of drawing, the opportunity cost is the drawing you didn't make. Economists use this term to describe what we give up whenever we make a choice — even choosing to do nothing has an opportunity cost.

**Predict**: To think ahead about what will happen as a result of your choice before you make it. When you predict, you're using your brain to imagine the future: "If I pick this one, I think it will be fun because..." Scientists make predictions before experiments, and good decision-makers make predictions before choosing.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: The Itsy Bitsy Spider

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
What's your criteria today?
Criteria help you weigh
Think about the trade-off too
What you'll gain and what you'll lose

*Verse 2*
Predict what you think will be
Opportunity cost you'll see
When you pick this, not pick that
Think about what you gave back

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point left and right with both index fingers alternating (pick this or pick that)
2. Tap forehead gently with one finger (thinking and deciding)
3. Clap hands together once (celebrate the choice made)

## Activity

### Activity Overview

In this decision-making activity, children practice the structured process of making choices: identifying their criteria (what matters to them), evaluating trade-offs (what they gain vs. what they give up), predicting outcomes, and reflecting on whether their prediction matched reality. They experience opportunity cost firsthand — discovering that every choice means something else was left behind — a foundational concept in economics and rational thinking.

**Activity Type**: Cognitive challenge / Decision science / Economics concepts

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards or images showing simple choices (animals, foods, colors, activities)
- Toys or objects representing different options (two stuffed animals, multiple toy vehicles, etc.)
- Simple props (baskets, boxes) to hold choice options
- Story cards or scenarios (can be homemade drawings)

**Optional**:
- Coins or tokens for voting or choosing
- Dice for decision games (roll to pick)
- Small reward tokens (stickers, buttons) to track choices
- Spinner or container for random selection

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (use household items, homemade cards, and toys you have)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Prepare 2-3 simple choice options (exactly 2-3, not more)
2. Make sure all options are genuinely appealing—avoid trick choices where one is obviously "better"
3. Arrange materials so the child can see all options clearly at eye level
4. Create a relaxed, playful atmosphere—not like a test

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Start by naming what we're doing: "Today we're going to practice making decisions like scientists and economists do! That means we don't just pick — we think about our criteria first, we look at the trade-offs, and we predict what will happen." Show two options and connect to their life: "Remember yesterday you chose the red cup? What was your criteria? Was it the color? The size? Today we're going to think about WHY we choose what we choose."

2. **Exploration** (10-15 min):

   **Phase 1: Criteria Discovery** (5-8 min)
   Present two options side by side (e.g., a big red block and a small blue block): "Before you pick, let's think about your criteria — what matters to you right now? Is it the color? The size? The shape?" After they choose, name their criteria: "You picked the big red one. It sounds like your criteria was size — you wanted the bigger one!" Try another round: "This time, can you tell me your criteria BEFORE you pick?"

   **Phase 2: Trade-offs and Opportunity Cost** (5-8 min)
   After each choice, name the trade-off and opportunity cost: "You picked the smooth ball. The trade-off is that you didn't get the bumpy one. The bumpy one is your opportunity cost — it's what you gave up. Do you wish you had it, or are you happy with your trade-off?"

   Make opportunity cost tangible: put two appealing toys in front of them, let them pick one, then gently set the other aside. "See? The one I'm putting away — that's your opportunity cost. Every choice has one."

   **Phase 3: Prediction Games** (remaining time)
   Play story scenarios with prediction built in: "The teddy bear is hungry — should he eat apples or fish? What do you predict will happen if he eats the apples?" After they predict, reveal the outcome. Ask: "Was your prediction right? Did what you expected actually happen?" Create branching stories where their choice leads to different outcomes, making predictions concrete.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Reflect on the decision process, not just the outcome: "What criteria did you use for your favorite choice today? What was your biggest trade-off? Did any of your predictions turn out differently than you expected?" Name the cognitive process: "When you thought about what might happen before choosing, that's called predicting. When you noticed what you gave up, that's opportunity cost. You're thinking like an economist!"

4. **Wrap-Up** (2-3 min):
   Signal a wind-down: "We have time for one more choice. Before you pick, tell me: what are your criteria? What's the trade-off? What do you predict will happen?" Reflect: "Today you learned that every choice has criteria, trade-offs, and opportunity cost. That's how the smartest decision-makers in the world think — and you're already doing it!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use only 2 choices, not 3 or more. Make options very concrete and visually distinct (different colors, sizes, or textures). Use real objects they know, not abstract concepts. Focus on preference choices, not complex decision-making. Accept all communication methods (pointing, looking, vocalizing). Keep duration to 15-20 minutes and provide high adult support.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce 3 options or simple multiple-choice scenarios. Add complexity with consequences: "If we pick the story, we'll listen. If we pick the game, we'll play together." Introduce voting and group decision-making. Invite reasoning: "Tell me why you picked that one." Create prediction games: "What do you think will happen if we pick this?" Role-play scenarios requiring social decision-making. Can extend activity to 20-25 minutes.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Story-Based Decision Games**
Tell simple stories where characters need to make choices. Pause and ask: "What should the bear do—go inside or play outside?" Then reveal what happened based on their choice (always making it an interesting outcome, not a lesson).

**Variation 2: Consequence Chain**
Make decisions where each choice leads to new situations and new choices: "You picked red—now the red door opens. Should we go inside or keep looking?" Create a branching story based on their decisions.

**Variation 3: Prediction Voting**
Present a scenario and ask them to predict what will happen or what someone would choose: "If the bunny could choose, would it pick carrots or cookies?" Then discuss their reasoning.

**Variation 4: Role Reversal Games**
Let them be the one making the offer of choices: "Now you pick two things for me to choose from!" This inverts the power dynamic and gives them ownership.

**Repeat play**: Integrate decision-making into real routines: "Do you want breakfast first or getting dressed first?" "Do you want the blue cup or red cup?" This extends the practice beyond game time into daily life.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't make a choice or seems overwhelmed by options

**Solution**: Reduce to exactly 2 options. Make them very different from each other. Remove pressure by saying "You can take your time" or "I'll pick first" to model how you decide. Sometimes just moving forward without a choice is okay.

**Challenge**: Child always picks the same thing or seems not to have real preferences yet

**Solution**: This is developmentally normal. Keep offering choices. Occasionally point out patterns: "You keep picking red—you really like red!" Over time, preferences will emerge. Avoid suggesting preferences they don't show.

**Challenge**: Child gets upset if their choice "doesn't work out" (e.g., they pick a toy and it's not as fun as expected)

**Solution**: Reframe as learning, not disappointment: "Now you know what that's like. Next time you can pick different." Validate feelings: "You're sad it wasn't as fun as you hoped. That's okay." Offer a new choice without rescuing them from the consequence.

**Challenge**: Child pressures you to always pick what they pick, or becomes focused on getting your approval

**Solution**: Explicitly separate your choices: "I like the green one, but you picked the yellow one. Both are great. You're the boss of your choice." Let them make different choices than you and celebrate both being right.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. Keep a choice journal—photograph or write down choices they made over time to celebrate their preferences and developing autonomy
2. Refer back to patterns in their choices—"Remember you always pick the red cup? Shall we get you a red one?" (shows respect for their growing autonomy)
3. Use their choices to learn about them—their selections reveal interests that can inform what activities to offer next
