# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Decision-Making Games

## Activity Summary

Decision-making games help young children develop the cognitive skill of choosing between options, weighing simple consequences, and taking responsibility for their choices. Through playful games like "pick this or that," story-based choices, or simple voting activities, children practice autonomous decision-making in a low-stakes, fun environment. These games build confidence in making choices and understanding that their preferences and ideas matter.

## Vocabulary

**Autonomy**: The freedom and ability to make your own choices and decisions. When you choose what toy to play with or which snack you want, you're showing autonomy—being in charge of what happens to you.

**Consequence**: What happens as a result of a choice or action. If you choose to play outside, the consequence is that you get fresh air and exercise. Understanding consequences helps you think about what might happen before you decide.

**Preference**: Something you like or enjoy more than other things. Your preference might be to play with blocks instead of drawing, or you might prefer apple slices to banana. Everyone has different preferences, and that's what makes people special.

**Reasoning**: Thinking through why something is true or why you made a choice. When you explain "I picked the red one because I like red," you're using reasoning—explaining your thinking and the reasons behind your decision.

*Verse 1*
When you pick this or you pick that
Think about what's in your hat
You can choose what feels just right
Make your choice, that's our delight

Every choice you make is great
Learn from what you pick today
What you choose will help you see
What will make you happily

## Activity

### Activity Overview

In this decision-making activity, children practice choosing between options, exploring what happens when they make different selections, and developing confidence in their own preferences. They'll play games where they select items, predict outcomes, and experience the natural consequences of their choices—all in a supportive, playful environment where there are no wrong answers.

**Activity Type**: Cognitive challenge / Social-emotional learning / Game-based learning

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards or images showing simple choices (animals, foods, colors, activities)
- Toys or objects representing different options (two stuffed animals, multiple toy vehicles, etc.)
- Simple props (baskets, boxes) to hold choice options
- Story cards or scenarios (can be homemade drawings)

**Optional**:
- Coins or tokens for voting or choosing
- Dice for decision games (roll to pick)
- Small reward tokens (stickers, buttons) to track choices
- Spinner or container for random selection

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (use household items, homemade cards, and toys you have)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Prepare 2-3 simple choice options (exactly 2-3, not more)
2. Make sure all options are genuinely appealing—avoid trick choices where one is obviously "better"
3. Arrange materials so the child can see all options clearly at eye level
4. Create a relaxed, playful atmosphere—not like a test

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Start with genuine excitement: "Today we get to make some fun decisions!" Show the options with enthusiasm and connect to their life: "Remember yesterday you chose the red cup? Today we're making choices again!" Clarify that they get to decide and explain any consequences simply without pressure.

2. **Exploration** (10-15 min):

   **Phase 1: Simple Two-Option Choices** (5-8 min)
   Present two options side by side: "Do you want the red one or the blue one?" Wait patiently for their response. Honor however they communicate their choice (pointing, looking, vocalizing). Make a small comment about their choice without judgment.

   **Phase 2: Consequence Exploration** (5-8 min)
   Gently introduce simple cause-and-effect: "Remember you picked the smooth texture—feel how smooth it is." Offer multiple rounds with slightly different types of choices (preference, texture, size, action). Notice patterns in what they seem to prefer.

   **Phase 3: Decision-Based Games** (remaining time)
   Play story scenarios: "The teddy bear is hungry—should he eat apples or fish? What do you think?" Create cause-and-effect games where their choice leads to an interesting outcome. Introduce simple voting: "I like the duck, but what do you like?"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Be genuinely curious about their choices. Ask follow-up questions like "Why did you pick that one?" without requiring an answer. Ensure they experience the consequences of their choice. Celebrate their decision-making: "You made a choice!"

4. **Wrap-Up** (2-3 min):
   Signal a wind-down: "We have time for one more choice." Reflect on their decision-making: "You made so many good choices today." Ask a reflection question: "What was your favorite choice we made?" Offer to remember: "I'll remember you picked the red one—that's your favorite."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use only 2 choices, not 3 or more. Make options very concrete and visually distinct (different colors, sizes, or textures). Use real objects they know, not abstract concepts. Focus on preference choices, not complex decision-making. Accept all communication methods (pointing, looking, vocalizing). Keep duration to 15-20 minutes and provide high adult support.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce 3 options or simple multiple-choice scenarios. Add complexity with consequences: "If we pick the story, we'll listen. If we pick the game, we'll play together." Introduce voting and group decision-making. Invite reasoning: "Tell me why you picked that one." Create prediction games: "What do you think will happen if we pick this?" Role-play scenarios requiring social decision-making. Can extend activity to 20-25 minutes.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Story-Based Decision Games**
Tell simple stories where characters need to make choices. Pause and ask: "What should the bear do—go inside or play outside?" Then reveal what happened based on their choice (always making it an interesting outcome, not a lesson).

**Variation 2: Consequence Chain**
Make decisions where each choice leads to new situations and new choices: "You picked red—now the red door opens. Should we go inside or keep looking?" Create a branching story based on their decisions.

**Variation 3: Prediction Voting**
Present a scenario and ask them to predict what will happen or what someone would choose: "If the bunny could choose, would it pick carrots or cookies?" Then discuss their reasoning.

**Variation 4: Role Reversal Games**
Let them be the one making the offer of choices: "Now you pick two things for me to choose from!" This inverts the power dynamic and gives them ownership.

**Repeat play**: Integrate decision-making into real routines: "Do you want breakfast first or getting dressed first?" "Do you want the blue cup or red cup?" This extends the practice beyond game time into daily life.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't make a choice or seems overwhelmed by options

**Solution**: Reduce to exactly 2 options. Make them very different from each other. Remove pressure by saying "You can take your time" or "I'll pick first" to model how you decide. Sometimes just moving forward without a choice is okay.

**Challenge**: Child always picks the same thing or seems not to have real preferences yet

**Solution**: This is developmentally normal. Keep offering choices. Occasionally point out patterns: "You keep picking red—you really like red!" Over time, preferences will emerge. Avoid suggesting preferences they don't show.

**Challenge**: Child gets upset if their choice "doesn't work out" (e.g., they pick a toy and it's not as fun as expected)

**Solution**: Reframe as learning, not disappointment: "Now you know what that's like. Next time you can pick different." Validate feelings: "You're sad it wasn't as fun as you hoped. That's okay." Offer a new choice without rescuing them from the consequence.

**Challenge**: Child pressures you to always pick what they pick, or becomes focused on getting your approval

**Solution**: Explicitly separate your choices: "I like the green one, but you picked the yellow one. Both are great. You're the boss of your choice." Let them make different choices than you and celebrate both being right.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. Keep a choice journal—photograph or write down choices they made over time to celebrate their preferences and developing autonomy
2. Refer back to patterns in their choices—"Remember you always pick the red cup? Shall we get you a red one?" (shows respect for their growing autonomy)
3. Use their choices to learn about them—their selections reveal interests that can inform what activities to offer next
