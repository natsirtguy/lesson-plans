# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Different Languages Around the World

## Activity Summary

Children discover that people around the world speak many different languages and that words sound different in different places. Through listening, mimicking, and exploring words from various languages, children develop awareness of global diversity and appreciation for how people communicate in unique ways. This lesson expands their understanding beyond their native language while introducing them to sounds and cultures from around the world.

## Vocabulary

**Language**: A special system of sounds and words that people use to talk and communicate with each other. Just like you speak English, people in other countries speak different languages like Spanish, Mandarin, or French.

**Communicate**: To share your thoughts, feelings, or ideas with someone else by speaking, singing, or using words. When you tell a friend a joke, you are communicating.

**Culture**: The special way of life that a group of people share, including their food, music, games, holidays, and the words they use to talk with each other. Your family's culture includes the language you speak and the songs you sing.

**Words**: The sounds we put together to name things and tell other people what we mean. "Apple," "manzana," and "pomme" are all different words for the same fruit in different languages.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: London Bridge Is Falling Down

**Tempo**: Cheerful and welcoming

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Language helps us communicate
Communicate, communicate
Language helps us communicate
Words around the world

Hola, bonjour, hello too
Hello too, hello too
Hola, bonjour, hello too
Different words we say

*Verse 2*
Every culture speaks its way
Speaks its way, speaks its way
Every culture speaks its way
Languages so bright

We communicate with our words
With our words, with our words
We communicate with our words
All around the earth

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point to mouth on "language" and "words" to show where speech comes from

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore actual sounds from different languages by listening to and attempting to repeat greetings and simple words. They will discover how languages sound different while finding similarities and enjoying the fun of trying new sounds. This hands-on exploration builds phonological awareness while fostering curiosity about global diversity.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration and interactive listening

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Smartphone or tablet with internet access (to play audio samples)
- Simple picture cards with words written in English and one other language (e.g., "Hello / Hola", "Dog / Perro")
- Chart paper or whiteboard to write words

**Optional**:
- Printable flashcards with flags of different countries
- Audio recording app (to record child's attempts)
- Global map or globe to point to countries
- Picture book showing children from different countries

**Cost**: Free (if using videos/online resources) to Under $5 (if printing materials)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Test audio quality and load 4-5 short video clips or audio samples of greetings in different languages (Spanish "hola," Mandarin "ni hao," French "bonjour," Arabic "assalamu alaikum," Japanese "konnichiwa")
2. Arrange a comfortable listening space where child can hear clearly
3. Gather any picture cards or visual aids
4. Safety check: Ensure volume is at appropriate level for young ears (not too loud)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Begin by asking: "Do you know that not everyone in the world speaks the same words as we do? Some people say 'hello' in a different way. Let's listen to how people in different places say hello!" Show a globe or point to the world and smile to create excitement about discovery.

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   Play audio samples of 4-5 greetings from different languages, one at a time. After each sample:
   - Ask the child to listen carefully
   - Say the word together slowly
   - Encourage the child to repeat it (even if pronunciation isn't perfect—celebrate the attempt!)
   - Show a picture card or point to the country on a map
   - Ask: "Does that sound like how we say hello?"
   Repeat with 2-3 different words (not just greetings—try "cat," "water," "thank you")

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Ask guiding questions:
   - "Which word sounded the silliest to your ears?"
   - "Did any of the words sound a little bit like English?"
   - "Can you pick your favorite language sound?"
   - "Do you think people who speak Spanish understand English?" (Help child understand different languages are different codes for talking)
   Play a favorite sample again and let the child repeat multiple times. Celebrate each attempt with enthusiasm.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Say: "People all around the world speak different languages, but we can all understand a smile and listen to each other. You just learned words in languages from far away! That makes you a super listener." Sing a few lines of the learning song together if desired.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use only 2-3 languages (keep simpler)
- Focus primarily on greetings and simple actions (jump, clap)
- Shorter listening segments (1-2 minutes total)
- Use repetition: play the same 3 words multiple times rather than introducing many new ones
- More emphasis on sounds and less on meaning
- Use gestures that match the words (wave for "hello," point to self for "me")

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce 5-7 different languages
- Use more varied vocabulary: greetings, animals, colors, family words
- Ask deeper questions: "Why do you think people have different languages?"
- Encourage comparing sounds: "Does Spanish sound softer than Mandarin?"
- Write simple words in different scripts (even if child can't read) to show languages look different too
- Challenge: Can you make up your own "silly language" with different sounds?

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Language Music Tour**: Find short clips of children's songs from different countries (Spanish lullabies, French nursery rhymes, Japanese children's songs) and listen to music from around the world instead of just words.

**Variation 2 - Flags & Languages**: Match countries with their primary languages using a globe, map, or printable flashcards. Create a simple display: "In Spain, people speak Spanish!" with a flag image.

**Repeat play**: Introduce different languages each time (don't repeat the same languages for 2-3 days so each session feels fresh and exciting). Create a "language wall" where you add a new word each day. Let the child record their own voice saying the words to play back later.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is reluctant to repeat or feels shy about making "funny" sounds.
**Solution**: Model lots of exaggerated attempts yourself first and laugh at your own mistakes. Say things like, "That word is tricky! Let's try it together. Listen how I say it... now you try. It doesn't have to be perfect—we're having fun exploring!" Remove any pressure to be "correct."

**Challenge**: Child loses interest or attention span is short.
**Solution**: Keep initial introductions very brief (2-3 minutes) and do multiple short sessions throughout the day rather than one long session. Pair language exploration with movement: say a Spanish word, then jump; say a Mandarin word, then spin around.

**Challenge**: Child asks "Why do people talk different?"
**Solution**: This is a wonderful question! Simple answer: "Every group of people created their own special words and sounds to talk to each other. Just like your family might have special nicknames, different countries have their special language code. It's like everyone has their own awesome way of talking!"

### Follow-Up Activities
1. **Daily word**: Pick one new word in a different language each morning and use it throughout the day (breakfast time: "Buenos días, good morning!")
2. **Cultural meals**: Prepare or taste food from a different country and learn the word for that food in that country's language (tacos/Mexican Spanish, pasta/Italian, rice/Japanese)
3. **Video pen pals**: Find age-appropriate videos of children from different countries singing, dancing, or saying hello to build connections and show that children everywhere play and communicate similarly
