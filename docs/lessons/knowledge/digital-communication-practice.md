# ARTS & CULTURE ACTIVITY: Digital Communication Practice

## Activity Summary

Digital communication practice introduces young children to safe, age-appropriate ways of connecting with others through technology. Children will learn basic digital literacy skills by using tablets, computers, or video call tools to interact with family, send simple messages, or create digital content together. This activity bridges the digital and social worlds, building comfort with technology while emphasizing that technology is a tool for human connection, not a replacement for in-person interaction.

**Activity Type**: Communication/Digital Literacy/Social Activity

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Mess Level**: Low - minimal physical mess, but requires careful device handling

**Best Environment**: Quiet space with comfortable seating, good lighting, stable surface for device

4. Set device volume to appropriate, safe level
5. Position device where child can see and interact comfortably

**Environment setup**:
- Create a calm, distraction-minimized space (not overly stimulating background)
- Ensure stable surface to prevent device from falling
- Position lighting so child's face is visible on screen
- Have seating at child's eye level with the camera
- Keep interaction time focused and short for attention span

**Device safety**:
- Keep device in secure holder or case
- Ensure cords are out of reach
- Set up parental controls as needed
- Position screen at appropriate distance from eyes (12+ inches)
- Have wipes nearby for cleaning screen afterward

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (1-2 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Build excitement: "We're going to visit with [person's name] on the screen! Say hello!"
- Show child the device and explain they'll see the other person
- Demonstrate how the camera shows them on screen
- Point to where they'll see the other person

**Setting expectations**:
- This is a conversation, like talking to someone on the phone
- The person on the other end can see them and hear them
- They get to choose what to show or talk about
- It's okay to feel a little shy at first

### Main Activity (8-15 minutes)

**Phase 1: Connection & Greeting** (2-3 minutes)
Establish the connection and warm greeting
- Start the video call or open messaging app with recipient ready
- Wave and say hello together
- Let child look at themselves on screen briefly
- Have other person greet child in familiar, warm way

**Phase 2: Guided Interaction** (5-8 minutes)
Facilitate meaningful exchange
- Suggest simple topics: "Show [person] your toy," "Tell them what you had for lunch," "Draw something and show them"
- Ask the other person to ask child simple questions
- Encourage child to respond or show things from their environment
- If child is hesitant, adult can model conversation first
- Use visual prompts (hold up objects, point to things around the space)

**Phase 3: Interactive Expression** (remaining time)
Child's own communication choices
- Let child lead the conversation naturally
- They might draw, show toys, dance, sing, or just chat
- Other person can draw along if using shared digital drawing app
- Keep momentum light and playful; don't force participation
- Celebrate what child shares or expresses

**Adult role**:
- Supervise all device use closely
- Help facilitate conversation without dominating
- Interpret child's attempts to communicate
- Gently redirect if child gets frustrated or distracted
- Remain calm and patient if child feels shy or resistant

### Wrap-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Give advance notice: "We'll say goodbye in one more minute"
- Lead child in waving goodbye
- Talk about what they shared
- Affirm their communication: "They really enjoyed seeing you!"

**Transition to next activity**:
- Close app/end call gently
- Acknowledge any feelings child might have
- Move to next activity as natural transition
- If this was meaningful, note that you can do it again another day

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Approach**:
- Keep sessions very brief (5-10 minutes maximum)
- Use very familiar adults only (parent not present, grandparent, etc.)
- Focus on visual communication (showing, waving) more than conversation
- Adult should be very involved in guiding interaction
- Use simple, repeated words and phrases
- Have a favorite toy or object to show
- Expect shyness or reluctance; that's developmentally normal

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes

**Adult support**: Very hands-on; adult narrates, suggests, and facilitates throughout

### 3-4+ years

**Extensions**:
- Can engage in more extended conversations (up to 15-20 minutes)
- Can follow a more structured activity with the other person (drawing together, singing together, telling a story back and forth)
- May ask questions and be curious about how the technology works
- Can use drawing or message apps to create and share content
- Might enjoy receiving messages/pictures from the other person between sessions
- Can plan what they want to share or talk about beforehand
- Capable of more independence with adult checking in

**Duration**: They may engage for 15-20 minutes if conversation is engaging

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1 - Drawing Together**: Open a simple shared drawing app and both child and distant relative draw together, narrating what they're creating

**Variation 2 - Show and Tell Story**: Child prepares 2-3 favorite objects to show and tell about to the person on screen; other person asks follow-up questions

**Variation 3 - Singing and Movement**: Both participants sing a familiar song or do simple dance moves together through the video call

**Variation 4 - Morning/Bedtime Ritual**: Establish a regular daily goodbye (morning) or goodnight (bedtime) video call as part of routine with specific family member

**Variation 5 - Create Together**: Child and other person take turns adding to a story or collaborative drawing across multiple sessions

**Variation 6 - Message Chain**: If child is older, send simple picture messages back and forth throughout the week (adult-supervised and sent from adult's account)

**Thematic variations**:
- Holiday video calls with extended family
- Birthday message compilations from relatives
- Teaching long-distance family member about new skills child has learned
- Language learning calls with bilingual relative

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Digital communication reflects modern human connection practices. In today's world, technology enables families separated by geography to maintain relationships. While in-person interaction remains most important for young children's development, thoughtful use of technology teaches that digital tools can sustain relationships. Many cultures now use video calls as a primary way extended family stays connected across distances.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Facilitate calls with relatives from different cultural backgrounds, speaking different languages
- Show child how people around the world use similar tools to connect
- Discuss how technology brings different cultures closer together
- Introduce apps and platforms from different countries/cultures

**Books/Media**:
- "Click, Clack, Moo: Christmas on the Farm" by Doreen Cronin (includes themes of connection)
- "Llama Llama Misses Mama" by Anna Dewdney (explores connection across distances)

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is shy or refuses to interact on camera
**Why**: Young children often experience social anxiety or aren't comfortable seeing themselves on screen; this is completely normal developmentally
**Solution**: Don't force interaction. Let child watch and listen first without pressure to speak. Start with shorter sessions (2-3 minutes). Use drawings or showing objects instead of talking. Normalize it by participating alongside child. Try again another day without pressure.

**Challenge**: Child gets overstimulated or frustrated with technology
**Why**: Screens can be overwhelming for some children, especially if connection is laggy or the experience is unfamiliar
**Solution**: Keep sessions brief. Reduce background stimulation. Try a simpler app or platform. Have a comfort item nearby. End the session gracefully if child is upset. Approach again more gradually.

**Challenge**: Long distance relative wants to spend extended time in call, but child loses interest
**Why**: Young children have limited attention spans; even enjoyable activities need breaks
**Solution**: Set clear time expectations before starting. Give child a visual timer showing how much time remains. Plan the most engaging part of the interaction toward the end. Consider multiple shorter sessions rather than one long one.

**Challenge**: Child becomes distracted by the app or device rather than the connection
**Why**: Technology features can be more interesting than conversation to young children
**Solution**: Minimize distracting elements. Keep apps simple. Return focus to the person on screen frequently. Use the device as a tool for connection, not entertainment.

### Tips for Success

- **Start with familiar people**: Begin with immediate family members child sees regularly in person; branch out gradually
- **Have a reason to connect**: Rather than "just a video call," have a specific purpose (say goodnight, show something new, hear a story)
- **Keep it short and sweet**: 5-15 minutes is ideal; it's better to end while child is still engaged than to let them get bored
- **Position the camera at eye level**: This makes the experience feel more natural and helps child focus on the other person's face
- **Use the technology purposefully**: Tech is a bridge for connection, not a substitute for in-person time
- **Celebrate the connection**: "Grandma loved seeing you today!" reinforces the relationship-building aspect

### What to Do With the Creation

- **Save digital messages or drawings**: Screenshot or download and save in a digital folder organized by date/person
- **Print special communications**: Frame a drawn picture received from a distant relative or print messages as keepsake
- **Create a digital scrapbook**: Compile screenshots and recordings of video calls into a digital album
- **Share with other caregivers**: Send snapshots to other parents/guardians to document child's communication growth
- **Reflect on connections**: Review messages/calls periodically to show child how their relationships grow
