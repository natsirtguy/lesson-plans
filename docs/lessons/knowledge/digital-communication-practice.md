# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Digital Communication Practice

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Digital communication practice introduces young children to safe, age-appropriate ways of connecting with others through technology. Children will learn basic digital literacy skills by using tablets, computers, or video call tools to interact with family, send simple messages, or create digital content together. This activity builds comfort with technology while emphasizing that it is a tool for human connection, not a replacement for in-person interaction.

## Vocabulary

**Digital literacy**: Understanding how to use technology tools like tablets and computers to communicate and create. When you know how to safely use a video call to talk with Grandma or send a picture to a cousin, you are building digital literacy skills.

**Facilitate**: To help make something happen or work smoothly. When you help your child take turns drawing with a grandparent on a shared drawing app, you are facilitating their connection with that person.

**Interaction**: Communication and engagement between people. A video call where you wave, talk, show toys, and listen to each other is a meaningful interaction between two people.

**Connection**: A relationship or link between people who care about each other. When your child draws a picture and shows it to a grandparent through a video call, they are maintaining a connection across the distance.

*Verse 1*
The little girl tapped on the screen so bright
And saw her grandma's smiling face
They waved hello and said hello
And shared a warm and loving place

*Verse 2*
They drew together, drew with care
And showed each other what they made
The lines and colors came alive
As distant loved ones reconnected, swayed

## Activity

### Activity Overview

This activity guides children through a supported digital communication experience with a trusted adult or family member. The child will use a device to see and interact with someone they care about, learning that screens can help people stay connected. Through conversation, showing objects, drawing together, or singing, the child practices using technology as a tool for meaningful human connection.

**Activity Type**: Communication/Digital Literacy/Social Activity

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes (testing connection, confirming recipient availability)

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Tablet, computer, or smartphone with internet access (parent/caregiver supervised)
- Age-appropriate communication app (FaceTime, Zoom, Marco Polo, or similar)
- Trusted adult or family member who will be on the other end of the call, confirmed in advance
- Comfortable seating at eye level with the device

**Optional**:
- Stylus or touchscreen-friendly items for interactive drawing
- Kid-safe video call platform (Marco Polo, Zoom for Kids)
- Simple digital drawing app (Paper, Procreate Dreams, or free web-based options)
- Headphones with volume limiting for comfort
- A favorite toy or object to show the other person
- Digital props or silly backgrounds for video calls

**Cost**: Free-$5 (uses existing devices; most apps are free)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Test internet connection and ensure device audio/video work properly
2. Confirm the person on the other end is ready and available to receive communication
3. Explain to your child who they will be talking with and why
4. Set device volume to a safe, appropriate level
5. Position the device where your child can see and interact comfortably

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Build excitement about the connection. Say, "We're going to see [person's name] on the screen! Let's wave hello!" Show your child the device and demonstrate that the camera lets the other person see them too. Point to where they'll see the other person on screen.

2. **Connection & Greeting** (2-3 minutes):
   Start the video call or open the messaging app with the recipient ready. Wave and say hello together. Let your child look at themselves on screen briefly if they're curious. Have the other person greet your child warmly and in a familiar way.

3. **Guided Interaction** (5-8 minutes):
   Facilitate meaningful exchange by suggesting simple activities: "Show [person] your toy," "Tell them what you had for lunch," or "Let's draw something for them." Ask the other person to ask your child simple questions. Encourage your child to respond, show things, or point to things around the space. If your child is hesitant, model conversation first. Use visual prompts by holding up objects or pointing to things.

4. **Child-Led Play** (Remaining time):
   Let your child lead the conversation naturally. They might draw, show toys, dance, sing, or just chat. The other person can draw along if using a shared drawing app. Keep the momentum light and playful without forcing participation. Celebrate what your child shares.

5. **Wrap-Up** (2-3 minutes):
   Give a gentle warning: "We'll say goodbye in one more minute." Lead your child in waving goodbye. Talk about what they shared or showed. Affirm their communication: "They really enjoyed seeing you today!" Close the app gently and transition naturally to the next activity.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep sessions very brief (5-10 minutes maximum). Use only very familiar adults. Focus on visual communication like showing, waving, and pointing more than conversation. Be very hands-on in guiding interaction and narrating what's happening. Use simple, repeated words and phrases. Have a favorite toy ready to show. Expect shyness or reluctance—this is developmentally normal and not a problem.

**3-4+ years**:
Children can engage in more extended conversations (15-20 minutes). They can follow a more structured activity with the other person, such as drawing together, singing together, or telling a story back and forth. They may ask questions about how the technology works. They can use drawing or message apps to create and share content. They might enjoy receiving messages or pictures from the other person between sessions. Allow them more independence with you checking in periodically.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Drawing Together**: Open a simple shared drawing app and both child and the person on screen draw together, narrating what they're creating. Encourage back-and-forth turns.

**Variation 2 - Show and Tell Story**: Your child prepares 2-3 favorite objects to show and tell about. The other person asks follow-up questions to extend the conversation.

**Variation 3 - Singing and Movement**: Both participants sing a familiar song or do simple dance moves together through the video call. This is especially fun for younger toddlers.

**Variation 4 - Ritual Connection**: Establish a regular daily video call—morning goodbye or bedtime goodnight—as part of your routine with a specific family member. Consistency builds comfort.

**Variation 5 - Message Chain**: For older children, send simple picture messages back and forth throughout the week (adult-supervised from an adult's account). Creates anticipation between sessions.

**Repeat play**: Try different apps or formats. Call different family members. Revisit the same person regularly to build relationship. Document how your child's comfort and conversational skills grow over time.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is shy or refuses to interact on camera.
**Solution**: Don't force interaction. Let your child watch and listen first without pressure to speak. Start with very short sessions (2-3 minutes). Suggest showing objects or drawing instead of talking. Normalize the experience by participating alongside your child. Try again another day without pressure. Shyness with cameras is completely normal developmentally.

**Challenge**: Child gets overstimulated or frustrated with the technology.
**Solution**: Keep sessions brief. Reduce background stimulation and distracting visuals. Try a simpler app or platform. Have a comfort item nearby. End the session gracefully if your child is upset. Approach again more gradually over multiple sessions.

**Challenge**: The distant relative wants an extended call, but your child loses interest.
**Solution**: Set clear time expectations before starting (tell the other person "we have about 10 minutes"). Give your child a visual timer showing how much time remains. Plan the most engaging part of the interaction toward the end. Consider multiple shorter sessions rather than one long call.

**Challenge**: Child becomes distracted by app features rather than the connection itself.
**Solution**: Minimize distracting app elements. Keep interfaces simple. Return focus to the person on screen frequently. Use the device as a tool for connection, not entertainment. Close or silence notifications.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Save and Share**: Screenshot or save special messages and drawings. Create a digital folder organized by date and person. Review these periodically with your child to show how relationships grow.

2. **Extend the Connection**: Print a drawing received from a distant relative or frame it. Create a digital scrapbook of video call screenshots. Send updates to other caregivers showing your child's communication growth.

3. **Plan Ahead**: Before the next call, ask your child what they want to show or talk about. Help them gather toys or ideas. This builds anticipation and gives them agency in the interaction.
