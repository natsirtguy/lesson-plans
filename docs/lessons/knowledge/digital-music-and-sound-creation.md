# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Digital Music and Sound Creation

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Children explore the world of electronic sounds and music-making through interactive apps or websites designed for early learners. By touching buttons, dragging objects, or tapping the screen, children discover that sound is vibration — and that computers can capture, encode, and recreate those vibrations digitally. This activity introduces the physics of sound, the basics of how digital audio works, and fosters creative expression through hands-on music composition.

## Vocabulary

**Frequency**: How fast something vibrates back and forth, measured in Hertz (Hz). Higher frequency = higher pitch (like a squeaky voice or piccolo). Lower frequency = lower pitch (like a drum or a tuba). A child's voice vibrates around 250 Hz; a bass drum around 50 Hz.

**Amplitude**: How big or strong a vibration is. Large amplitude = loud sound. Small amplitude = quiet sound. When you turn up the volume, you are increasing the amplitude of the sound waves.

**Waveform**: The shape of a sound wave — how the air pressure rises and falls as sound travels. Digital music apps often show waveforms as wavy lines on a screen. A smooth wave (sine wave) sounds soft and pure; a jagged wave sounds buzzy and sharp.

**MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)**: A system that encodes musical events as numbers — which note, how loud, how long — rather than recording actual sound. When you tap a piano key in a music app, a MIDI signal tells the computer "play note C4 at medium volume for half a second." Invented in 1983, MIDI is still used in nearly all digital music today.

**Sampling**: Recording a real sound (like a real piano or drum hit) and storing it digitally so a computer can play it back. Many music apps use thousands of samples — recordings of real instruments — triggered by tapping the screen.

**Tempo**: The speed at which music plays, measured in BPM (beats per minute). 60 BPM = one beat per second. Dance music is often 120-140 BPM. A slow lullaby might be 60-70 BPM.

**Timbre**: The unique sound "color" of an instrument, caused by the specific mix of overtones (extra vibrations) it produces alongside the main note. A piano and a violin playing the same note have different timbres because their vibration patterns include different combinations of overtones.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Baa, Baa, Black Sheep

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses):

*Verse 1*
Sound is vibrations through the air,
High and low and everywhere,
Fast vibrations — high and bright,
Slow vibrations — deep at night.

*Verse 2*
Computers count the sounds we make,
Every note a number takes,
MIDI tells it when to play,
Digital music every day.

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Tap fingers fast on the table for high-frequency sounds, slow for low-frequency
2. Raise hands high for loud (big amplitude), lower them for quiet (small amplitude)
3. Draw a wavy line in the air to show a waveform

## Activity

### Activity Overview

In this hands-on activity, your child becomes a music creator using a tablet, smartphone, or computer. They'll explore how digital tools turn their touches into sound, discover that different instruments have different waveforms and frequencies, and create their own musical compositions. The goal is not just to make music — it is to understand that sound is physics, and that digital music is physics encoded as numbers.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression, Digital exploration, Science of sound

**Duration**: 10-25 minutes (depending on age)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes (open app, test audio, adjust volume)

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Tablet, smartphone, or computer with internet access
- Chrome Music Lab (free, no download needed: musiclab.chromeexperiments.com) — especially "Song Maker" and "Spectrogram"
- Audio output: Built-in speakers or child-safe headphones with volume limiter

**Optional**:
- Bluetooth speaker for better sound quality
- Percussion instruments nearby (drum, shaker) to compare real vs. digital sound
- Tuning fork if available — shows real vibrations you can touch and feel

**Cost**: Free (Chrome Music Lab) to $10-15 (for premium apps)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Open Chrome Music Lab on your device (musiclab.chromeexperiments.com)
2. Open both "Spectrogram" and "Song Maker" tabs — you'll use both
3. Test audio and adjust to safe volume (~60-70 dB, not louder than a normal conversation)
4. If you have a tuning fork or rubber band, have it ready for the vibration demonstration

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction — Sound is Vibration** (3-4 minutes):
   Before touching the screen, demonstrate vibration physically. Pluck a rubber band and let your child touch it lightly while it vibrates: "Feel that? That shaking is how ALL sound works. Your voice does it. Every instrument does it." If you have a tuning fork, tap it and touch it to a table surface — the buzz they feel IS the sound wave.

   Explain: "When something vibrates fast — high frequency — we hear a high sound. Slow vibrations make low sounds. The tablet makes sounds by making air vibrate using a tiny speaker."

2. **Spectrogram Exploration** (3-5 minutes):
   Open the Spectrogram in Chrome Music Lab. Have your child hum low, then high, into the microphone. They'll see different colors appear at different heights on the screen. Explain: "The low sounds show up at the bottom. High sounds show up at the top. That picture is showing us the frequency — how fast the vibrations are."

   Let them clap, tap the table, sing different vowels, and see the shapes change. Ask: "What shape does your voice make? What about a clap?"

3. **Song Maker — Creating with MIDI** (5-10 minutes):
   Open Song Maker. Explain: "When we tap here, we're not recording our voice. We're sending a message — a MIDI message — that tells the computer 'play this note, this loud, this long.' The computer plays back a sample — a recording of a real instrument — when it gets that message."

   Let your child create a short melody. Point to notes at the top of the grid (high) and bottom (low): "Top notes have higher frequency. Bottom notes have lower frequency." Let them discover the relationship between position and pitch.

4. **Compare Real vs. Digital** (2-3 minutes):
   If you have a drum or shaker, let the child hit it, then find a similar sound in the app. Ask: "Which is louder? Which one do you feel in your hand? The real drum vibrates the air you can touch — the tablet's speaker is doing the same thing, just much smaller."

5. **Wrap-up** (2 minutes):
   Let your child pick their favorite sound to end with. Ask: "Is that a high-frequency sound or a low one? Is it loud amplitude or quiet?" Celebrate attempts to use the real words.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus on the physical vibration demonstration — let them feel the rubber band, the speaker, and hear the difference between high and low
- Use only the Spectrogram and one feature in Song Maker
- Use simplified language: "fast wiggles = high sound, slow wiggles = low sound"
- Keep sessions shorter (10-15 minutes)
- Repetitive tapping is normal and great — narrate what they're doing: "Every time you press that, the computer sends a signal and plays the note!"

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce "frequency" and "amplitude" as real words: "Say it with me — fre-quen-cy"
- Explore Song Maker's tempo slider and have them count beats per minute
- Use recording features to play back what they created
- Challenge: "Can you make a song that starts quiet (small amplitude) and gets louder?"
- Introduce the concept: "Every note you see is stored as a number in the computer — that's called MIDI"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Vibration Hunt**: Go around the house touching things that are making sounds — the refrigerator hum, a fan, a running tap. Every sound = something vibrating. Ask: "What's vibrating here? Is it high or low frequency?"

**Variation 2 - Waveform Art**: Show your child what sine waves and square waves look like. Let them draw their own "waveforms" — squiggly lines representing sound. Then try to find those shapes in the Spectrogram.

**Variation 3 - Instrument Families by Timbre**: In Song Maker, switch between instrument sounds (marimba, piano, strings). Listen for how they differ even on the same note. Explain: "They all have the same frequency — same pitch — but different timbre. Different overtones, different wave shapes."

**Variation 4 - Build a Beat with BPM**: Use a metronome app alongside Song Maker. Start at 60 BPM and increase to 120. Count together: "60 beats per minute means one beat every second — like a ticking clock."

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated when the app doesn't respond or seems broken
**Solution**: Stay calm and matter-of-fact. Say: "The app is thinking. Let's wait a second." Restart if needed. This is also a real-world lesson: computers process digital signals and sometimes need time.

**Challenge**: Child wants to press the same button over and over
**Solution**: This is completely normal and valuable! Narrate the physics: "Every time you press that, you're sending the same MIDI signal, and the computer plays the same note. You're making a rhythm — a repeating pattern." After repetition, gently introduce a variation: "What if we change the frequency — press a higher one?"

**Challenge**: Child gets upset when it's time to stop
**Solution**: Prepare in advance: "Two more sounds and then we're done." Offer to save or screenshot what they made so it feels preserved.

**Challenge**: Child wants to watch instead of create
**Solution**: Fine — learning happens through watching too. Use this as an opportunity to narrate the science: "Watch how the high notes on the screen go at the top? That's showing us high frequency. The low notes are down here — slower vibrations."

**Challenge**: Concerns about screen time from other caregivers
**Solution**: Frame this as physics and music science, not passive screen time. Emphasize the Spectrogram's visualization of real sound waves and the hands-on vibration experiments that accompany it. Keep sessions to 15-20 minutes max and balance with unplugged sound exploration.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Sound journal**: After each session, draw pictures of the waveforms they saw or the sounds they made. Label them with "high frequency" or "low frequency."

2. **Physical art from sounds**: After making music digitally, let your child paint what the sounds looked like on the Spectrogram — swirls for high frequencies, wide bands for low ones.

3. **Unplugged music**: Follow up with hands-on instruments — drums, shakers, or pots and pans. Let your child create similar patterns with real instruments, then ask: "If we could see your drum hit on the Spectrogram, what shape do you think it would make?"
