# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Disaster Relief for Toys/Dolls

## Activity Summary

Children participate in a dramatic play scenario where toys and dolls have experienced a pretend "disaster" and need rescue and care. But this isn't just play — it is grounded in how real disaster relief actually works. Children learn about triage (sorting by urgency), the logistics of relief operations, the organizations that help (like the Red Cross), and the hierarchy of basic human needs. Through imaginative roleplay, they practice empathy, nurturing skills, and systematic problem-solving while engaging with concepts from emergency management and humanitarian aid.

## Vocabulary

**Triage**: A French word (from "trier" = to sort) used in medicine and disaster response to describe the process of sorting people or situations by urgency — who needs help first, who can wait, who needs the most resources. In emergency medicine, triage uses a color system: red (critical, immediate), yellow (urgent but stable), green (minor), black (beyond help). Real paramedics, ER nurses, and disaster relief workers use triage every day.

**Humanitarian aid**: Help given to people affected by disasters or crises — food, water, shelter, medical care, and psychological support. Organizations like the Red Cross, UNICEF, and Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) provide humanitarian aid around the world. "Humanitarian" means caring about human welfare above all else.

**Infrastructure**: The basic systems and structures a community depends on — roads, bridges, water pipes, electricity lines, hospitals. When a disaster strikes, infrastructure is often damaged first, which makes everything else harder: doctors can't reach patients, clean water can't flow, lights don't work. Restoring infrastructure is one of the first priorities in disaster relief.

**Basic needs hierarchy**: The idea (from psychologist Abraham Maslow, 1943) that human survival needs come in order of priority: first physiological needs (air, water, food, warmth, shelter), then safety, then social connection. Disaster relief works in this order — you secure air, water, food, and shelter before worrying about anything else.

**Triage**: Sorting injured or affected people/animals by urgency so that limited resources go where they are most needed. Without triage, helpers might spend all their time on minor problems while someone critical goes without help.

**Logistics**: The planning and organization of moving supplies, people, and equipment to where they're needed. In disaster relief, logistics means: How do we get food from a warehouse to 500 people who need it? Which roads are passable? What vehicle do we use? Good logistics saves lives.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Mary Had a Little Lamb

**Tempo**: Purposeful and caring

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Triage first, who needs help most,
Needs help most, needs help most,
Triage first, who needs help most,
Red, then yellow, green.

Water, food, and shelter first,
Shelter first, shelter first,
Water, food, and shelter first —
Basic needs, we bring.

*Verse 2*
Red Cross helpers travel far,
Travel far, travel far,
Red Cross helpers travel far
With logistics planned.

Humanitarian aid we give,
Aid we give, aid we give,
Humanitarian aid we give —
A helping hand.

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Sort imaginary objects into groups on "triage" — pointing left, center, right to show sorting
2. Pretend to carry supplies on "logistics" — walking in place with an imaginary box
3. Draw a cross shape on your chest on "Red Cross" — the universal symbol of humanitarian aid

## Intro Video Recommendation

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children create a pretend disaster scenario for toys or dolls, then run a systematic relief operation — not just emotional caregiving, but organized, prioritized, real-world-style disaster response. They will practice triage (sorting by urgency), logistics (planning what goes where), and providing basic needs in the correct order. The dramatic play format makes these real concepts tangible and engaging while building empathy and problem-solving skills simultaneously.

**Activity Type**: Dramatic play / Humanitarian aid simulation / Systems thinking

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Toys, dolls, stuffed animals, or action figures (5-8 items, more than usual — disaster scale)
- Colored paper or tape: red, yellow, and green pieces (for triage tags)
- Soft cloths or washcloths (for cleaning and medical care)
- Small basin or bowl of warm water
- Blankets or small towels (shelter)
- Small cups or toy bottles (water supplies)

**Optional**:
- Band-aids or homemade paper bandages
- A "supply depot" box with relief items
- A "field hospital" area set apart from the general camp
- Small toy vehicles for transporting supplies (logistics)
- A map drawn on paper showing the "disaster zone" and "base camp"

**Cost**: Free (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Set up a "disaster zone" by arranging toys scattered around a space — some tipped over, some buried under a blanket (representing rubble), some in the open
2. Set up a separate "base camp" area with supplies: cloths, water, blankets, cups
3. Make triage tags: cut small pieces of red, yellow, and green paper
4. Optional: draw a rough map showing disaster zone, base camp, and a "hospital" area

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction — What Just Happened?** (3-4 min):
   Set the scene: "There was a big earthquake (or flood, or storm) and our toys need help. But we can't just run in and grab the first toy we see — disaster relief workers have a plan. They use something called triage — that means sorting who needs help most urgently."

   Explain the color system: "Red means critical — needs help right now. Yellow means urgent — needs help soon, but okay for a minute. Green means minor — scratched or scared, but safe for now. We're going to walk through the disaster zone carefully and give each toy a triage tag before we do anything else."

2. **Triage Walk-Through** (5-6 min):
   Walk through the disaster zone together. For each toy, ask: "Is this one in danger right now? Are they breathing? (pretend) Are they stable?"
   - Toy buried under rubble = Red tag (trapped, needs immediate rescue)
   - Toy tipped over, arm broken = Yellow tag (injured but not in immediate danger)
   - Toy just scared and in the open = Green tag (needs comfort, not urgent medical care)

   Sort them into three zones on the floor. Ask: "Which ones do we help first? Why?"

3. **Logistics Planning** (3-4 min):
   Before diving in, plan the operation: "What do our toys need? Water? Food? Blankets? Medicine?" List (or draw) what you have and what each group needs. Ask: "How do we get supplies from base camp to the red zone? We have to carry them — that's logistics. We need a plan."

   Build a simple supply route: "First we bring water to the red zone, then blankets to yellow, then comfort to green."

4. **Relief Operation** (8-10 min):
   Execute the plan in order:
   - Red zone: rescue (lift out of rubble), provide "medical care" (bandage, water), stabilize
   - Yellow zone: treat injuries, provide blankets (shelter), water
   - Green zone: comfort, check in, provide food and company

   As you work, narrate: "We're meeting their basic needs in order — first safety (getting them out of danger), then water, then warmth and shelter. This is exactly what the Red Cross does after real disasters."

   Point out the organizational structure: "See how we're not running around randomly? We have a plan — that's what makes disaster relief work."

5. **Debrief — What Did We Learn?** (3-4 min):
   After all toys are cared for, review: "What was triage? What does the Red Cross do? What do people need first in a disaster — water, shelter, or fancy toys?" Review the basic needs hierarchy: "Water and food and shelter come first. That's always the priority."

   Ask: "What would happen if we hadn't done triage? What if we'd spent all our time with the green toys while red ones were still trapped?"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Simplify to two triage categories instead of three: "needs help NOW" and "can wait a minute"
- Focus on two or three concrete concepts: "We bring water first because bodies need water to survive"
- Use the word "triage" and "Red Cross" — these are not too big; children this age love unusual words
- Keep the scenario simple: one disaster type, 3-4 toys
- Do the triage sorting together rather than expecting independent classification
- Repeat the basic needs priority: "Water first. Then warm. Then food."
- Keep activity to 15-20 minutes with more caregiver narration

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce all three triage colors and their meanings
- Let the child lead the triage assessment and justify their decisions: "Why did you give that one a red tag?"
- Discuss real organizations: "The Red Cross, UNICEF, and Doctors Without Borders go to disasters around the world"
- Add logistics complexity: count supplies and figure out if there's enough for everyone
- Introduce the concept of limited resources: "We only have 3 bandages and 5 yellow-tag toys — how do we decide?"
- Draw a map and trace the supply route
- Connect to real-world events: "Remember when we heard about a flood on the news? People like this help after floods."

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 — Toy Hospital**: After the initial disaster relief, set up a longer-term field hospital. Introduce the concept of recovery time: "Some toys will get better quickly (green), some need weeks (yellow), some need special care for a long time (red)." Track "patient" progress over several days of play.

**Variation 2 — Supply Chain Problem**: Set up the scenario so supplies are far from the disaster zone. Ask: "How do we move the water over there? We have a toy truck — can we plan a route?" This introduces transportation logistics and problem-solving.

**Variation 3 — Different Disaster Types**: Research together (briefly) what different disasters do to infrastructure: floods damage roads and contaminate water; earthquakes damage buildings; hurricanes knock out electricity. Adapt the disaster scenario and relief response accordingly.

**Variation 4 — Real Organization Research**: Look up the Red Cross or UNICEF together — most have simple kid-friendly sections on their websites. Find out one real thing they do after disasters and incorporate it into the play.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: The child wants to jump in and help immediately, ignoring the triage system.

**Solution**: This is the natural impulse — and it's worth teaching why it's not always most effective. Say: "In real disasters, helpers who run in without a plan sometimes miss the people who need them most. Triage makes sure no one falls through the cracks. Let's try the plan first, then see if it worked better." This is a real lesson in systems thinking.

**Challenge**: The child is rough with the toys or treats the rescue like rough play.

**Solution**: Model gentleness and connect it to real care: "Real rescuers are very careful with injured people — sudden movements can make injuries worse. Let's be gentle just like they are." Frame carefulness as a skill, not just a behavior rule.

**Challenge**: The child becomes distressed by the disaster scenario.

**Solution**: Keep scenarios positive and solvable. Emphasize the helpers: "The disaster is scary, but look — we're HERE. We have a plan and supplies and we know what to do. That's exactly how real relief workers feel." If distress persists, simplify or pause and return later.

**Challenge**: The child asks about real disasters or if this could happen to them.

**Solution**: Answer honestly and reassuringly: "Real disasters do happen sometimes — earthquakes, floods, storms. But there are thousands of people who train their whole lives to help when they do. And our job is to know what the basics are: water, shelter, safety first." This is age-appropriate honesty without false promises.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Real-world connection**: When a news story mentions a natural disaster, briefly show a photograph of relief workers in action. Say: "See? Triage. Basic needs first. That's exactly what we practiced." Keep it brief and matter-of-fact — not scary.

2. **Supply kit**: Create a simple pretend "emergency kit" together: a small backpack with water, a snack, a flashlight. Talk through what goes in and why — this reinforces the basic needs hierarchy in a practical way.

3. **Map-making**: Draw a simple map of your home or neighborhood. Mark where water and food are. Ask: "If we couldn't use our kitchen, where else could we find water?" This gentle emergency preparedness thinking is age-appropriate and empowering.
