# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Emergency Preparedness Activities

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Children explore what emergencies are, why communities prepare for them, and how real emergency systems work — from smoke detectors to evacuation routes to 911. Through hands-on activities and role-play, children learn actual preparedness concepts: fire needs fuel, oxygen, and heat to burn; smoke rises so you crawl low; first responders are specially trained people who practice every day; and having a plan in advance means your brain doesn't have to think under pressure. The goal is confident understanding, not just reassurance.

## Vocabulary

**Emergency**: A sudden event that threatens health or safety and requires a fast, trained response — like a fire, flood, injury, or missing person.

**First Responder**: A person with specialized training whose job is to be first on the scene during emergencies — includes firefighters, paramedics, and police officers.

**Evacuation**: Leaving a building or area quickly and safely using a planned route to reach a safer location.

**Evacuation Route**: A specific, pre-planned path from a building to a safe meeting place — practiced ahead of time so people don't have to figure it out during an emergency.

**911**: The emergency phone number in North America that connects you to a dispatch center, where trained operators send the right first responders to your location.

**Smoke Detector / Fire Alarm**: A device that detects smoke particles in the air and sounds a loud alarm to warn people before a fire gets big.

**Fire Triangle**: The three things fire needs to burn: fuel (something to burn), oxygen (from the air), and heat. Remove any one and the fire goes out — this is why firefighters use water (cools heat) and foam (cuts off oxygen).

**Triage**: The process first responders use to quickly decide who needs help most urgently when multiple people are injured.

**Preparedness**: Having a plan and practicing it *before* an emergency happens, so your body and brain already know what to do.

**Tune**: She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain

**Tempo**: Steady, confident

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
When the smoke alarm goes beeping, we move fast
When the smoke alarm goes beeping, we move fast
We crawl low where air is clean
Smoke rises — that's what we've seen
When the smoke alarm goes beeping, we move fast

*Verse 2*
We all meet at our spot outside the house
We all meet at our spot outside the house
One meeting place, we all know where
No going back in — stay right there
We all meet at our spot outside the house

*Verse 3*
Nine-one-one calls trained helpers right away
Nine-one-one calls trained helpers right away
Tell your name and where you are
Dispatchers know just near and far
Nine-one-one calls trained helpers right away

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. During "smoke alarm beeping" — clap hands rhythmically like an alarm
2. During "crawl low" — drop hands toward the floor, show crawling motion
3. During "meeting place" — point to a designated spot in the room
4. During "nine-one-one" — mime pressing phone buttons one, then one, then one

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children learn real emergency preparedness through three interconnected activities: building a fire triangle demonstration, practicing a home evacuation drill, and assembling a mini emergency kit. Each activity teaches a real mechanism or skill, not just themed play.

**Activity Type**: Practical skills/Science exploration/Safety training

**Duration**: 30-40 minutes

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper, scissors, red/orange/yellow crayons for fire triangle diagram
- Three index cards labeled: FUEL, OXYGEN, HEAT (or draw flames and write together)
- Tape for marking an evacuation route through your home
- Toy phone or disconnected real phone for 911 practice
- Small backpack or bag for emergency kit assembly
- Emergency kit items: water bottle, granola bar, flashlight, bandage, whistle

**Optional**:
- Smoke detector to show and describe (not activate — unless outdoors or with windows open)
- Red/orange tissue paper "flames" for fire triangle activity
- Map of your home (hand-drawn is fine) to mark evacuation routes
- Stopwatch to time the evacuation drill
- Walkie-talkies or simple radios to demonstrate communication

**Cost**: Free to $15 (most items are household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Walk through your home and identify two evacuation routes from key rooms
2. Choose and mark a meeting place outside (tree, mailbox, neighbor's porch)
3. Gather emergency kit materials into one spot
4. Pre-label the three fire triangle cards

**Activity Flow**:

1. **The Fire Triangle** (8-10 minutes):
   Hold up the three cards: FUEL, OXYGEN, HEAT. Explain: "Fire is a chemical reaction — it happens when three things come together at once." Arrange the cards in a triangle. "Fuel is something that burns — wood, paper, cloth. Oxygen comes from the air around us. Heat starts the reaction." Now: "What do firefighters do? They pour water — water cools the heat. Some fires get smothered with foam — that cuts off oxygen. When one side of the triangle is gone, the fire stops." Have children arrange and collapse the triangle. Ask: "Why do we keep matches and lighters away? Because we don't want all three sides together by accident." "Why is a fireplace screen important? It keeps fuel — like carpet and furniture — away from the heat."

2. **How Smoke Detectors Work** (5 minutes):
   Show a smoke detector if available. "This device has a tiny chamber inside. Smoke is made of particles — tiny bits floating in air. When particles drift into the chamber, they disrupt a small electric current, and that triggers the alarm." Key point: "It detects smoke *before* the fire gets big — that's why early warning saves lives." Explain why smoke rises: "Hot air from fire rises toward the ceiling, carrying smoke with it. That's why the alarm is on the ceiling. That's also why you crawl low during a fire — the cleanest air is near the floor."

3. **Home Evacuation Drill** (8-10 minutes):
   Walk through the evacuation plan together. "An evacuation route is a path we plan *before* an emergency so our brains don't have to work it out during one." Walk the route: from main rooms to the exit to the meeting place outside. Explain: "We have two routes in case one is blocked by fire or smoke." Practice: "When the alarm sounds, don't grab toys or look for pets. Leave immediately. Crawl if there's smoke. Close doors behind you — a closed door slows fire for up to 20 minutes." Time the drill. "Once outside, we go to the meeting place and stay there. No going back inside for anything. First responders are trained to go inside — we are not." For older children: "What if you can't get out? Close yourself in a room, seal cracks with cloth, signal from a window."

4. **Packing an Emergency Kit** (7-8 minutes):
   "Emergency preparedness means having what you need before you need it." Lay out items. "Why water? Your body can survive weeks without food but only days without water. Why a flashlight? Emergencies often knock out power. Why a whistle? If you're trapped, yelling uses energy — a whistle signal carries farther and lasts longer. Why a bandage? First responders practice triage — they help the most serious injuries first. Minor cuts we can manage ourselves." Let children pack the bag. "This bag goes near the door so we can grab it on the way out."

5. **911 Practice** (5 minutes):
   "911 is a special number that goes to a dispatch center — trained operators who stay calm and know exactly how to get help to you." Practice what to say: name, address, what is happening. "Dispatchers keep you on the line and send the right first responders — firefighters, paramedics, or police — while you talk." Emphasize: "You call 911 when there is a real emergency. You tell them your address because dispatchers can figure out roughly where a call came from, but not exactly — your address gets help there faster."

6. **Wrap-Up** (3-5 minutes):
   Review the fire triangle together. Ask: "What are three things fire needs?" "Why do we crawl low?" "Where is our meeting place?" "What goes in an emergency kit?" Post the evacuation route map somewhere visible.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on two concrete skills: knowing your meeting place and knowing to crawl low when there's smoke. Practice the drill physically — make it a game. Use the fire triangle cards as a sorting game (color them). Keep 911 discussion simple: "If something scary happens, a grown-up calls this special number." Use the stuffed animals to practice the drill ("Bunny goes first, then you, then me").

**3-4+ years**:
Children can explain the fire triangle and why water puts out fires. They can memorize their home address for 911 purposes. Let them lead the evacuation drill — they give the signal and direct the route. They can discuss different types of emergencies: fire, earthquake (drop/cover/hold), tornado (go to lowest floor interior room away from windows). Introduce the concept of triage: "First responders have to make quick decisions about who needs help first."

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Earthquake Drill**
Teach "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" — get under a sturdy table, hold on so it doesn't move away, protect your head. Explain: "Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates — giant sections of Earth's crust — shift suddenly, sending shockwaves through the ground." Practice the drill at an unexpected moment.

**Variation 2: Fire Triangle Experiment**
Light a candle (adult only). Show that it goes out when covered with a jar (oxygen removed). Discuss: "We didn't cool it, we didn't remove the fuel — we blocked the oxygen." For older children, discuss why blowing on a campfire makes it bigger (adds oxygen) while blowing out a candle snuffs it (moves heat away).

**Variation 3: Emergency Map**
Draw a simple floor plan of your home together. Mark two exits from each main room. Draw arrows showing evacuation routes. Mark the outdoor meeting place. Post it near the entrance. Update it when you move furniture.

**Repeat play**: Practice the evacuation drill monthly — make it routine. Update the emergency kit seasonally (check batteries, replace expired food). Learn one new type of emergency each season (flood: move to high ground; tornado: lowest interior room; power outage: flashlights, no candles near curtains).

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Children become anxious or fearful during safety discussions

**Solution**: Anxiety usually comes from vagueness. The more specific and concrete the plan, the safer children feel. Replace "something bad might happen" with "if the alarm goes off, we do exactly this." Children who have practiced a drill feel confident, not scared. Avoid dwelling on worst-case scenarios — focus on the plan and their capability.

**Challenge**: Children don't understand why preparedness matters if nothing has happened yet

**Solution**: Connect to something they already understand. "We practice fire drills at school even though the school hasn't burned. We buckle seatbelts even on short trips. Preparedness means we're ready so we don't have to be scared." Fire departments practice every day — that's why they're so fast and skilled.

**Challenge**: Children want to go back inside during the drill to get toys or check on pets

**Solution**: This is the most important habit to build. Explain clearly: "We train ourselves not to go back in, because during a real fire your brain will want to, and we need your body to already know the rule." First responders are trained to go into fires — that is their expertise. Our expertise is getting out and staying out.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Monthly Drill**: Conduct a surprise evacuation drill. Time it. Celebrate improvement.

2. **Address Practice**: Help children memorize your home address — it's the most critical piece of information for 911.

3. **Community Connection**: If possible, visit a local fire station — firefighters often welcome visits and can show children equipment, explain their training, and reinforce that first responders practice constantly.
