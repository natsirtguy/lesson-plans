# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Emergency Preparedness Activities

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Through hands-on exploration and creative role-play, children develop confidence and understanding about community helpers and basic safety practices. This activity introduces children to the people and systems that keep them safe while helping them recognize important safety symbols and simple emergency responses. By engaging with props, creating safety posters, and acting out helpful scenarios, children learn that they can understand safety concepts and trust the adults and helpers around them.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore community helpers and safety concepts through a combination of picture exploration, guided poster creation, and imaginative role-play with props. During this activity, children will handle props, draw or color pictures for safety posters, and practice simple emergency scenarios through pretend play. They will learn who helps us stay safe and develop confidence by engaging with these concepts through play.

**Activity Type**: Social activity/Practical skills/Role-playing and simulation

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards of safety symbols (stop signs, fire exits, emergency phone numbers)
- Simple props for role-play (toy phones, firefighter hats, doctor bags, safety vests)
- Chart paper or poster board for creating safety posters
- Markers and crayons in various colors
- Picture books about community helpers and safety

**Optional**:
- Red and blue construction paper for emergency vehicle cutouts
- Stuffed animals or dolls for practice scenarios
- Toy telephone for practicing emergency calls
- First aid kit with child-safe items (bandages, gauze)
- Whistle or bell for signaling games
- Safety helmets or hard hats for dress-up play

**Cost**: Free to $10 (if purchasing simple props or printing materials)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all role-play props and arrange in accessible areas
2. Print or create simple picture cards showing community helpers
3. Set up clear floor space for movement and role-play activities
4. Designate different areas: role-play station, poster-making station, safety symbol station
5. Ensure safety by removing any sharp or hazardous items

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Start with a simple, calm question: "Do you know who helps people when they need help?" Show pictures of a firefighter, police officer, or nurse. Explain: "Today we're going to learn about people who help us stay safe and what we can do to be safe." Set simple expectations: "We're going to pretend and play, and you'll learn important skills that make you brave and smart."

2. **Exploration** (5-7 minutes):
   Show pictures of community helpers and let children touch and explore role-play props. Ask open questions: "What do you think this helper does?" and "How do they help us?" Point out simple safety symbols (stop sign, exit sign, phone symbol). Comment on their observations: "You noticed the red color on the fire truck! Fire trucks are red so people can see them."

3. **Guided Creation and Practice** (7-10 minutes):
   Introduce one safety concept at a time (fire safety, knowing your address, staying with grown-ups). Have children help draw or color pictures for a safety poster. Demonstrate simple emergency scenarios through role-play: "If there's a fire, we go to our meeting place." Ask questions: "Where would we go? Who would help us?" Let children practice simple responses.

4. **Free Expression and Role-Play** (remaining time):
   Provide props and let children choose their role (firefighter, nurse, helper, person needing help). Allow children to act out scenarios at their own pace. Ask gentle questions: "What happens next?" and "How can we help?" Narrate their play positively: "You're being so brave and helping your friend." Keep play light and clearly "pretend."

5. **Wrap-Up** (3-5 minutes):
   Gather in a circle and ask: "Who did we learn about today?" and "What makes us safe?" Celebrate their learning with specific praise. Display safety posters in the classroom and keep props accessible for continued play. Make cleanup part of the learning: "We keep our space safe by putting things away."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on simple concepts: knowing where grown-ups are, holding hands, recognizing helpers. Use very basic props (toy phone, simple hats) and keep activities more structured. Keep duration to 15-20 minutes. Use lots of reassurance and positive language. Provide lots of modeling, demonstration, and physical guidance. Keep activities one-on-one or in very small groups with frequent comfort check-ins.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce more specific safety concepts (fire exits, emergency numbers, meeting places). Practice basic scenarios: "What if you're lost?" or "What if there's a fire?" Have children create more detailed safety posters with labels and drawings. Let children lead role-play scenarios and teach others what they learned. Allow children to create their own safety situations to act out. Extend duration to 25-30 minutes as interest allows and support more complex pretend play with multiple children.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Community Helper Gallery Walk**
Create a simple gallery of pictures or drawings of different community helpers. Children walk around, point to pictures, and you narrate what each helper does. Children can draw or color their own helper pictures to add to the gallery.

**Variation 2: Safety Scavenger Hunt**
Hide simple safety items around your space (toy phone, first aid supplies, exit sign picture, helper picture). Children find items and you talk about what each one is used for. This adds movement and exploration.

**Variation 3: Emergency Dress-Up**
Set up a dress-up station with firefighter hats, safety vests, doctor masks, and other helper costumes. Children choose costumes and role-play helping others. This allows for extended imaginative play.

**Repeat play**: Different seasonal themes (fire safety in winter, water safety in summer), holiday safety topics, or inviting community helpers to visit. Focus on helpers that match children's current interests (animals with police dogs, vehicles with fire trucks).

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Children become anxious or scared during safety discussions

**Solution**: Use calm, reassuring language. Focus on "helpers" and "what we do to stay safe" rather than dangers. Keep activities light and playful. If a child shows fear, pause and reassure: "Grown-ups know how to help. That's their job. Your job is to be a kid and have fun." Avoid detailed explanations of emergencies and keep pretend play clearly labeled as "pretend."

**Challenge**: Children don't want to participate or seem disinterested

**Solution**: Don't force participation; let them observe first. Sometimes children learn by watching others. Use their interests to connect: if they love vehicles, focus on emergency vehicles; if they like helping, focus on helpers. Start with what they naturally enjoy and weave in safety concepts.

**Challenge**: Role-play becomes too dramatic or silly

**Solution**: Gently redirect while validating their play: "That's so funny! Now let's practice what a helper does." Keep some structure but allow playfulness. Understand that children process information through exaggeration and comedy, which is developmentally normal.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Ongoing Reinforcement**: Keep safety posters visible in your space and refer to them during daily routines. Talk about helpers you see: "Look, there's a police officer! Remember how they help keep us safe?"

2. **Home Extension**: Send home simple safety reminders or photos of the posters you created together. Ask families to discuss one safety helper they know or have seen in their community.

3. **Building Confidence**: Celebrate your child's growing knowledge about safety helpers and their role in staying safe. Use their learning in everyday moments: "You know what to do if we need help. You're so smart!"
