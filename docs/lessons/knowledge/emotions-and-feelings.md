# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Emotions and Feelings

## Activity Summary

Children learn to identify, name, and express their emotions through songs, activities, and conversations. This lesson helps young learners develop emotional literacy and begin understanding that all feelings are normal and valid, while building vocabulary for the feelings they experience every day.

## Vocabulary

**Limbic system**: A group of structures deep inside your brain that generate emotions. The amygdala (an almond-shaped cluster of neurons) detects danger and triggers fear. The hippocampus stores emotional memories — that's why a certain smell can suddenly make you feel happy or sad. Your limbic system is one of the oldest parts of the brain, shared with reptiles and other mammals.

**Neurotransmitter**: A chemical messenger molecule that carries signals between neurons (brain cells). Dopamine makes you feel pleasure and motivation. Serotonin helps you feel calm and content. Cortisol floods your body during stress and fear. Different emotions are produced by different combinations of these chemical messengers.

**Facial muscles**: Your face has over 40 muscles that work together to express emotions. The zygomatic major muscle pulls your mouth corners up into a smile. The corrugator supercilii muscle pulls your eyebrows down and together into a frown. Scientists have mapped every possible facial expression to specific muscle combinations — this system is called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS).

**Mirror neurons**: Special brain cells that fire both when you do something AND when you watch someone else do it. When you see someone smile, your mirror neurons activate the same brain areas as if you were smiling yourself — which is why emotions are contagious. This is a biological basis for empathy: your brain literally simulates what another person is feeling.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Wheels on the Bus

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, following 8-8-12 syllable structure):

*Verse 1*

The feel-ings in my heart go round and round
Round and round, round and round
The feel-ings in my heart go round and round, all through the day

*Verse 2*

When I'm hap-py, I smile big and bright
Smile so bright, smile so bright
When I'm sad, I might cry, but that's al-right, feel-ings are okay

**Actions/Gestures**:

1. **Heart circles**: Place both hands on heart and make slow circles to represent feelings moving through your body
2. **Smile wide**: Point to or trace your smile with both fingers moving across your face
3. **Gentle tears**: Use fingertip to trace down cheek like a tear falling, showing sadness is okay

## Intro Video Recommendation

**Recommended video**: Search for "In a Nutshell - Kurzgesagt: What are emotions?" or look for "Sesame Street: Emotions" series which offers age-appropriate content

**What to look for**:
- 2-5 minutes long
- Colorful animation or real children's faces showing different emotions
- Clear, simple language explaining feelings
- Characters expressing different emotions (happy, sad, angry, scared)
- Reassuring message that all feelings are normal

**Alternative searches**:

- "Super Simple Songs: Emotions" (slow, clear, perfect for 2-4 year olds)
- "Kids learning emotions and feelings video"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore emotions through a multi-sensory activity using emotion faces, mirrors, and expressive play. They'll identify emotions, make matching facial expressions, and discuss what makes them feel different ways. This helps them build emotional awareness and vocabulary in a concrete, playful way.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration and dramatic play

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper plates or cardboard circles (one per emotion)
- Markers or crayons (preferably primary colors)
- Small handheld mirror or reflective surface
- Picture cards of people expressing emotions (can be printed from internet or hand-drawn)

**Optional**:
- Fabric scraps for hair
- Googly eyes or buttons for eyes
- Popsicle sticks to attach faces to (puppet style)
- Photos of the child and family members expressing emotions
- Emotion poster or chart for reference

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (mostly using household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Create 4-5 emotion faces on paper plates: happy (wide smile, wide eyes), sad (turned down mouth, tears), angry (eyebrows down, frown), scared (wide eyes, open mouth), and calm/peaceful (soft smile, closed or gentle eyes)
2. Arrange materials on a low table accessible to the child
3. Ensure mirror is secure and won't break if dropped
4. Safety check: No small parts that could be choking hazards; markers are non-toxic

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   "Today we're going to learn WHERE feelings come from — they come from your brain! Deep inside your brain there's a part called the limbic system. It has a tiny piece called the amygdala." (Point to a spot behind the ear.) "The amygdala decides if something is scary or safe. When it detects danger, it sends chemical messengers called neurotransmitters racing through your brain and body — that's what makes your heart pound when you're scared."

   Show the emotion faces one at a time: "This is a happy face. When you feel happy, your brain is releasing a neurotransmitter called dopamine. When do YOU feel happy?" Wait for child's response. Repeat with each face, naming the brain chemistry: sad = lower serotonin, scared = amygdala activating cortisol, calm = serotonin.

2. **Exploration** (7-10 minutes):

   **Mirror exploration with facial muscle science**: Hold up the mirror. "Make a happy face! Now feel your cheeks — that muscle pulling your mouth up is called the zygomatic major. It's one of over 40 muscles in your face!" Try other emotions: "Make an angry face — feel your eyebrows pulling together? That's the corrugator supercilii muscle squeezing." Repeat with sad, surprised, scared — naming which muscles are moving each time.

   **Mirror neuron experiment**: Make a big smile at the child and watch. "Did you smile back? That's your mirror neurons! Special brain cells fired in your brain just from watching me smile. Your brain copied my emotion automatically — that's why feelings are contagious."

   **Facial Action Coding System game**: Show an emotion face and ask, "Can you make THIS face? Which muscles are you using?" Try mixing: "Can you make just the mouth smile but keep your eyebrows angry? It's hard because the brain tends to activate muscle groups together."

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):

   Connect body sensations to physiology:
   - "When you're scared, your heart beats faster. That's because your amygdala told your body to release cortisol and adrenaline — chemicals that prepare your muscles to run or fight. It's called the fight-or-flight response."
   - "When you're happy and relaxed, your brain is making serotonin. That's why a hug feels calming — touch triggers serotonin release."
   - "Can two different neurotransmitters be active at the same time? Yes! That's why you can feel excited AND nervous — dopamine (excitement) and cortisol (anxiety) at once."
   - "Why do we have emotions at all? They evolved to help animals survive. Fear keeps you away from danger. Happiness makes you seek out good things. Disgust keeps you from eating rotten food. Every emotion has a purpose."

   Point out: "Every human brain has the same limbic system. Everyone in the whole world feels these same emotions because we all have the same brain structures."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):

   "You learned about so many feelings today! Let's do our special feeling song one more time." Sing verse 1 of the learning song together with motions.

   Create a simple closing ritual: "Before we finish, show me your calm, happy face for the rest of the day."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus on just 2-3 emotions: happy, sad, scared (fewer to process)
- Use the real terms alongside simple ones: "Happy! Your brain is making dopamine!" "Scared! That's your amygdala!" — they'll absorb the vocabulary through repetition even without full comprehension
- Emphasize the mirror work — mirror neurons are directly observable: smile at them, watch them smile back, name what's happening: "Mirror neurons!"
- Focus on the facial muscle exploration — feeling muscles move is concrete and physical
- Expect shorter attention span; 10-12 minutes may be maximum
- Lots of repetition across multiple days

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce all major neurotransmitters by name: dopamine (pleasure/reward), serotonin (calm/contentment), cortisol (stress), adrenaline (excitement/fear), oxytocin (bonding/trust — released during hugs)
- Discuss the evolutionary purpose of each emotion: "Disgust evolved to stop our ancestors from eating poisonous or rotten food. That's why your face scrunches up — you're closing your nose and mouth to keep bad things out."
- Explore the Facial Action Coding System more deeply — try to isolate individual facial muscles and make "mixed" expressions
- Discuss physical sensations with physiology: "When I'm angry, my face gets hot because blood vessels dilate — more blood flows to my muscles. My fists clench because my body is preparing to fight. That's the fight-or-flight response."
- Theory of mind + mirror neurons: "Why do you think he looks sad? Your mirror neurons are helping you feel what he feels. That's called empathy — and it's built into your brain."
- Create a "brain chemistry chart" — which neurotransmitters go with which feelings

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Emotion Puppets**: Tape emotion faces to popsicle sticks to make puppets. Act out simple scenarios: "The happy puppet is playing! The sad puppet is lonely. Can the happy puppet help?" This adds dramatic play and problem-solving.

**Variation 2 - Emotion Hunt**: Take photos of the child making different emotional expressions throughout the day. Create a simple photo book: "Look! Here's you being happy at snack time. Here's you being calm at rest time." Return to this throughout the week to reinforce emotion vocabulary.

**Repeat play**: Change the emotion scenarios based on what's happening in the child's life. If it rained, talk about feeling disappointed. If they got a new toy, talk about feeling excited. Make the emotions personally relevant to keep it fresh and meaningful.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't want to make certain faces or tries to suppress emotions
**Solution**: Never force emotional expression. Instead, normalize all feelings: "Sometimes feelings are private. That's okay. But we know it's okay to feel sad/angry/scared. When you're ready to show me, I'm here." Model the emotions yourself. Children learn emotional expression by seeing trusted adults express feelings safely and recover from them.

**Challenge**: Child becomes upset during the activity when discussing sad or scary feelings
**Solution**: This is actually developmentally appropriate and shows the activity is resonating emotionally. Stay calm and present. Validate: "I see this made you feel sad. That's okay. Can I give you a hug?" Have comfort items nearby. The goal isn't happiness—it's emotional awareness. Your calm response teaches that feelings (even uncomfortable ones) are manageable.

**Challenge**: Child seems to only identify one emotion or can't distinguish between emotions
**Solution**: This is completely normal at ages 2-3. Continue exposure across many days without pressure. Use real-life moments throughout the day to point out emotions in others: "Look, the baby in this book is crying. The baby feels sad." Over time, their emotional recognition will grow naturally.

**Challenge**: Child seems emotionally flat or rarely shows expression
**Solution**: Some children are naturally more reserved. Model feelings frequently without requiring participation. Read books about feelings together. Play alongside them with emotion faces. If this is a significant change from their baseline or you have other concerns, check in with their healthcare provider or early childhood specialist.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Throughout the day**: Name emotions as you see them in the child's behavior or in characters in books. "You're jumping up and down—you sound excited!" This builds their emotion vocabulary naturally throughout daily life.

2. **Feelings check-ins**: At transitions (before bedtime, before leaving the park), ask "How are you feeling right now?" and listen to their response. Model the same: "I'm feeling calm right now."

3. **Connection to literature**: Read picture books about emotions regularly. Great options include "The Feelings Book" by Todd Parr, "Glad Monster, Sad Monster" by Ed Emberley, or "In My Heart" by Jo Witek. Pause to discuss characters' feelings.

4. **Calming strategies**: Once children can name feelings, introduce simple calming tools: deep breathing (smell a flower, blow out a candle), movement (jump, spin, shake), comfort (stuffed animal, blanket), or talking. Practice these during calm moments so they're available during upset moments.

5. **Emotion art**: Provide materials for free drawing/painting and ask "Can you paint how you're feeling today?" No judgment—just processing feelings through creative expression.
