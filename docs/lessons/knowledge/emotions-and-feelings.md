# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Emotions and Feelings

## Activity Summary

Children learn to identify, name, and express their emotions through songs, activities, and conversations. This lesson helps young learners develop emotional literacy and begin understanding that all feelings are normal and valid, while building vocabulary for the feelings they experience every day.

## Vocabulary Focus (3-4 words)

**Emotion**: A strong feeling inside your body that shows how you're doing right now—like happy, sad, angry, or scared. When you smile because something is funny, that's an emotion.

**Express**: To show or tell someone how you're feeling using your words, face, body, or voice. You can express happiness by laughing, or sadness by crying.

**Recognize**: To notice and identify something, like seeing a friend at the store or noticing when someone is sad because they're crying. We can recognize emotions on faces and in voices.

**Calm**: A peaceful, quiet feeling where your body is relaxed and your mind is still. You might feel calm when you're snuggled with a blanket or listening to soft music.

## Hands-On Knowledge Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore emotions through a multi-sensory activity using emotion faces, mirrors, and expressive play. They'll identify emotions, make matching facial expressions, and discuss what makes them feel different ways. This helps them build emotional awareness and vocabulary in a concrete, playful way.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration and dramatic play

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper plates or cardboard circles (one per emotion)
- Markers or crayons (preferably primary colors)
- Small handheld mirror or reflective surface
- Picture cards of people expressing emotions (can be printed from internet or hand-drawn)

**Optional**:
- Fabric scraps for hair
- Googly eyes or buttons for eyes
- Popsicle sticks to attach faces to (puppet style)
- Photos of the child and family members expressing emotions
- Emotion poster or chart for reference

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (mostly using household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Create 4-5 emotion faces on paper plates: happy (wide smile, wide eyes), sad (turned down mouth, tears), angry (eyebrows down, frown), scared (wide eyes, open mouth), and calm/peaceful (soft smile, closed or gentle eyes)
2. Arrange materials on a low table accessible to the child
3. Ensure mirror is secure and won't break if dropped
4. Safety check: No small parts that could be choking hazards; markers are non-toxic

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   "Today we're exploring all the different feelings we have! Everyone has lots of feelings—happy ones and sad ones, calm ones and excited ones. They're all okay. Let's learn about feelings together!"

   Show the emotion faces one at a time: "This is a happy face. When do YOU feel happy?" Wait for child's response. Repeat with each face.

2. **Exploration** (7-10 minutes):

   **Mirror exploration**: Hold up the mirror and invite the child to look at their own face. Say, "Make a happy face! Now look in the mirror—do you see your happy face?" Repeat with other emotions: sad, silly, calm, angry, surprised.

   **Matching game**: Show an emotion face and ask, "Can you make THIS face?" Child attempts to copy. Celebrate their expression: "Yes! That's a sad face!"

   **Storytelling prompts**:
   - "Show me the face you make when you get a big hug"
   - "Show me your face when you taste yummy food"
   - "Show me your face if you lost your favorite toy"
   - "Show me your calm, sleepy face"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):

   Ask reflective questions:
   - "What does your body feel like when you're happy? Are you bouncy or calm?"
   - "When you feel sad, what do you need? A hug? Someone to talk to?"
   - "Can two different feelings happen at the same time?" (Hint: yes! You can feel excited AND nervous)
   - "What helps you feel calm when you're upset?"

   Point out: "Every person in the whole world has all these feelings. Your feelings are important. They tell us something about what we need."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):

   "You learned about so many feelings today! Let's do our special feeling song one more time." Sing verse 1 of the learning song together with motions.

   Create a simple closing ritual: "Before we finish, show me your calm, happy face for the rest of the day."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus on just 2-3 emotions: happy, sad, calm (fewer to process)
- Use simpler, shorter sentences: "Happy! You're happy!" rather than explanations
- Emphasize the mirror work and facial expression copying (concrete, observable)
- Keep storytelling prompts very simple and connected to their immediate experience
- Expect shorter attention span; 10-12 minutes may be maximum
- Use the song to help transition and maintain engagement
- Lots of repetition across multiple days

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce 4-5 emotions including more nuanced ones: happy, sad, angry, scared, calm, excited, shy
- Ask "why" questions: "Why do you think he looks sad?" (encourages theory of mind)
- Discuss physical sensations more: "When I'm angry, my face gets hot and my fists get tight. What happens to YOUR body?"
- Introduce emotion combinations: "Can you feel happy AND sad at the same time? Like when your friend moves away?"
- Create a "feelings chart" together and revisit throughout the day
- Extend to solving problems: "If you're sad, what would help you feel better?"
- Introduce the idea of expressing feelings safely: "We can feel angry, but we use kind words instead of hitting"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Emotion Puppets**: Tape emotion faces to popsicle sticks to make puppets. Act out simple scenarios: "The happy puppet is playing! The sad puppet is lonely. Can the happy puppet help?" This adds dramatic play and problem-solving.

**Variation 2 - Emotion Hunt**: Take photos of the child making different emotional expressions throughout the day. Create a simple photo book: "Look! Here's you being happy at snack time. Here's you being calm at rest time." Return to this throughout the week to reinforce emotion vocabulary.

**Repeat play**: Change the emotion scenarios based on what's happening in the child's life. If it rained, talk about feeling disappointed. If they got a new toy, talk about feeling excited. Make the emotions personally relevant to keep it fresh and meaningful.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't want to make certain faces or tries to suppress emotions
**Solution**: Never force emotional expression. Instead, normalize all feelings: "Sometimes feelings are private. That's okay. But we know it's okay to feel sad/angry/scared. When you're ready to show me, I'm here." Model the emotions yourself. Children learn emotional expression by seeing trusted adults express feelings safely and recover from them.

**Challenge**: Child becomes upset during the activity when discussing sad or scary feelings
**Solution**: This is actually developmentally appropriate and shows the activity is resonating emotionally. Stay calm and present. Validate: "I see this made you feel sad. That's okay. Can I give you a hug?" Have comfort items nearby. The goal isn't happiness—it's emotional awareness. Your calm response teaches that feelings (even uncomfortable ones) are manageable.

**Challenge**: Child seems to only identify one emotion or can't distinguish between emotions
**Solution**: This is completely normal at ages 2-3. Continue exposure across many days without pressure. Use real-life moments throughout the day to point out emotions in others: "Look, the baby in this book is crying. The baby feels sad." Over time, their emotional recognition will grow naturally.

**Challenge**: Child seems emotionally flat or rarely shows expression
**Solution**: Some children are naturally more reserved. Model feelings frequently without requiring participation. Read books about feelings together. Play alongside them with emotion faces. If this is a significant change from their baseline or you have other concerns, check in with their healthcare provider or early childhood specialist.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Throughout the day**: Name emotions as you see them in the child's behavior or in characters in books. "You're jumping up and down—you sound excited!" This builds their emotion vocabulary naturally throughout daily life.

2. **Feelings check-ins**: At transitions (before bedtime, before leaving the park), ask "How are you feeling right now?" and listen to their response. Model the same: "I'm feeling calm right now."

3. **Connection to literature**: Read picture books about emotions regularly. Great options include "The Feelings Book" by Todd Parr, "Glad Monster, Sad Monster" by Ed Emberley, or "In My Heart" by Jo Witek. Pause to discuss characters' feelings.

4. **Calming strategies**: Once children can name feelings, introduce simple calming tools: deep breathing (smell a flower, blow out a candle), movement (jump, spin, shake), comfort (stuffed animal, blanket), or talking. Practice these during calm moments so they're available during upset moments.

5. **Emotion art**: Provide materials for free drawing/painting and ask "Can you paint how you're feeling today?" No judgment—just processing feelings through creative expression.
