# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Escape Room and Mystery Solving

## Activity Summary

Children develop problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and persistence through guided mystery-solving activities. In this lesson, kids become young detectives searching for hidden objects, following clues, and discovering solutions through observation and exploration—building confidence in their ability to solve challenges independently.

## Vocabulary

**Mystery**: Something that is hidden or unknown that we work to discover and understand. "We have a mystery to solve—where did the teddy bear go?"

**Clue**: A piece of information or evidence that helps us solve a puzzle or find something. "The picture on the paper is a clue—it shows us where to look next."

**Puzzle**: A challenge or problem that requires thinking and trying different ways to solve it. "This puzzle has pieces that fit together to make a picture."

**Solve**: To figure out the answer to a problem or mystery using our thinking skills. "We worked together to solve the mystery and found the toy!"

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Baa, Baa, Black Sheep

**Tempo**: Playful and curious

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Look, look for the clues
Yes we can, yes we can
Follow clues to solve the mystery
Find the puzzle, crack the code
Every clue will help us know
We can solve it, yes we can

*Verse 2*
Search and find what's hiding there
Yes we will, yes we will
Mystery solving takes our thinking
Use each clue to find our way
Puzzles help us learn today
We can solve it, yes we will

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Cup hand above eyes on "look" and scan around for clues like a detective
2. Point forward on "follow clues" as if tracing a path to solve the mystery
3. Make an "aha!" gesture (finger pointing up) on "solve" when you figure out the puzzle

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children search for hidden objects using simple clues you provide, learning to follow directions, observe their environment, and think through simple logical sequences. This hands-on exploration builds problem-solving confidence while encouraging active searching and playful discovery.

**Activity Type**: Guided discovery play with clue-following

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- One small toy or object to hide (stuffed animal, toy car, doll)
- Paper and crayons or markers (to draw simple clues)
- Household items to create "clue stations" (cushions, under table, in basket)

**Optional**:
- Treasure box or special container for the "prize"
- Colored paper with symbols or shapes drawn on it
- Small bell or rattle to ring as a "warm/cold" temperature guide
- Costume elements (detective hat, magnifying glass) for role play

**Cost**: Free (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Choose a small toy or object that's safe and engaging for your child's age
2. Plan a simple hiding spot (under a cushion, in a basket, behind a door)
3. Draw or write 2-3 simple clues on paper:
   - For ages 2-3: Pictures (draw a cushion, draw a toy car to show "look in the red box")
   - For ages 3-4+: Simple arrows, colors, or written words ("Look where we sit," "Find the soft place")
4. Hide the object in your chosen spot
5. Safety check: Ensure the hiding place is safe, accessible, and nothing can fall on the child

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Sit together and say: "We have a mystery to solve today! Something is hiding and we need to find it."
   - Show the first clue and ask: "What do you think this clue shows?"
   - Use excited, encouraging language: "We are detectives searching for treasure!"

2. **Exploration** (8-12 min):
   - Child searches while you provide verbal clues ("You're getting warm!" or "Look over there!")
   - Let them lead the search—follow their direction even if they don't find it immediately
   - If they seem stuck, give more specific hints: "Remember our clue? It showed something soft..."
   - When they discover the object, celebrate with excitement and praise: "You solved the mystery!"

3. **Discovery** (2-3 min):
   - Ask questions about what they found: "What was hiding? How did the clue help us?"
   - Let them open any treasure box or enjoy the found object
   - Ask: "Should we hide it again and look for more mysteries?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   - Discuss what they liked about the game
   - Store the toy and clue cards for next time
   - Transition to the next activity

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use only 1-2 very simple, obvious hiding spots (under a cushion in plain sight, in a basket they can see)
- Draw picture clues instead of words—draw exactly what they're looking for
- Hide something small but favorite (pacifier, stuffed animal, snack)
- Use "warm/cold" guidance with your voice to help—ring a bell that gets louder as they approach
- Keep the search area very small (one room or corner)
- Be hands-on; hold their hand while searching if they need support

**3-4+ years**:
- Hide objects in more challenging spots (behind a door, under blankets, in a cabinet they can safely open)
- Use 2-3 sequential clues that build on each other ("Look where we sit" → points to couch area, next clue "Look under soft things")
- Try simple symbol matching (draw a star, hide it under something with a star sticker)
- Introduce very basic color codes ("Look for the red box")
- Allow them to search independently for longer before giving hints
- Ask them to create their own clues and hide something for you to find

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Color Hunt**: Hide multiple small objects in different colored boxes or bags; child must find all of them using color words as clues.

**Variation 2 - Sound Detective**: Make a sound (jingle bells, tap wood, squeak toy) from a hidden location; child listens and follows the sound to find the source.

**Repeat play**: Change the hiding spot each time but keep similar clue types so the game stays fresh. Gradually increase complexity by adding more locations or reducing how obvious the clues are.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated and gives up quickly
**Solution**: Mystery solving requires persistence that's still developing in toddlers. If frustration appears, step in immediately with a very obvious hint or narrow the search area. Success builds confidence—make the first attempts easy so they experience winning. Celebrate the smallest discoveries.

**Challenge**: Child wants to skip the clues and randomly search
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal! Point out that random searching is also detective work. Say: "Great finding! You searched that spot. Now let's look at our clue to try this spot." Keep the game flexible and playful rather than rigid.

**Challenge**: Child is not interested in "pretend" clues or symbols
**Solution**: Use real, concrete information instead: point physically to locations, use their favorite songs to guide them ("Listen—we sing near the table!"), or hide something in a spot they can partially see and gradually remove visual hints.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Role play expansion**: Set up a "detective office" with a notebook where you write down clues about everyday items ("Where is the toy car?" child finds it and you "write it in your detective notebook")

2. **Story extension**: Read books about finding things or solving mysteries (like Daniel Tiger, Blue's Clues, or Pete the Puppy); point out how characters use clues

3. **Daily life connection**: Play "mystery" versions of everyday routines ("Where did we hide your shoes?" "Can you find your coat?") to build real problem-solving skills
