# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Evaluating Information

## Activity Summary

Children learn how humans figure out what's true — and how to catch errors in reasoning. Through hands-on "claim testing," they explore the difference between a claim and evidence, what makes a source reliable, why people can be wrong even when they're honest, and why we should check things ourselves rather than just believing them. This is the foundation of scientific thinking, healthy skepticism, and media literacy — applied to age-appropriate scenarios with physical, testable claims.

## Vocabulary

**Claim**: A statement that something is true. "The ball will roll farther on the smooth floor" is a claim. Claims need evidence — they aren't automatically true just because someone says them.

**Evidence**: Information gathered through observation, experiment, or careful measurement that helps you evaluate whether a claim is true or false. Evidence is stronger when it can be checked by other people.

**Source**: Where information comes from. Different sources are more or less reliable depending on how they know what they know. An expert who studied something for years is a more reliable source than someone who heard it from a friend.

**Bias**: When a source tends to see things in a slanted way due to their interests, experiences, or wants. A company claiming its toy is the best toy ever has a bias — they want you to buy it. Bias doesn't mean lying; it means that where you stand shapes what you see.

**Experiment**: A procedure designed to test a claim by creating controlled conditions where you can observe the outcome. Good experiments test one thing at a time.

**Logical Fallacy**: An error in reasoning — when a conclusion doesn't actually follow from the evidence. "My grandmother smoked and lived to 100" doesn't mean smoking is safe — one example isn't enough data. This is called an "anecdote," and a common mistake is treating anecdotes like proof.

**Peer Review**: In science, before a finding is accepted, other experts independently check the work. This catches mistakes and bias that the original researchers might have missed.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Wheels on the Bus

**Tempo**: Thoughtful and steady

**Lyrics**:

*Verse 1*
Before we believe what someone says
What someone says, what someone says
Before we believe what someone says
We ask "how do they know?"

Did they see it? Did they test it?
Did they test it, did they test it?
Did they see it? Did they test it?
Or did they just hear it too?

*Verse 2*
One example's not enough, enough
Not enough, not enough
One example's not enough, enough
We need to see a pattern

Let's try it and see what happens
See what happens, see what happens
Let's try it and see what happens
Evidence tells us true

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Touch chin with finger on "ask how do they know" — the thinking gesture
2. Shade eyes with hand on "did they see it" — looking carefully
3. Hold one finger up on "one example" then spread all fingers for "pattern"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children test claims physically — starting with simple, testable predictions about objects — and experience the difference between guessing, observing, and deliberately testing. They also play a "source check" game where they evaluate whether a statement came from a reliable source or not. Both activities are concrete, hands-on, and age-appropriate while introducing genuine epistemological concepts.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on science exploration, reasoning practice

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- 3-4 pairs of objects with testable differences (small ball + large ball; smooth ramp board + rough towel ramp; heavy block + light block)
- A simple ramp (board leaning on a book, or a cardboard tube)
- Crayons and paper for recording predictions
- "Source cards" — 4-6 index cards with made-up scenarios (see instructions)

**Optional**:
- Ruler or measuring tape to quantify results
- Magnifying glass
- Small notebook for recording

**Cost**: Free (household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
Make 4-6 "Source Cards" — simple scenarios on index cards. Examples:
- "Your friend says the red block is heavier than the blue block. [How could we check? We could weigh them!]"
- "A TV commercial says this toy is the BEST toy. [Is that a reliable source? They want to sell it!]"
- "A doctor says washing your hands prevents illness. [Is this reliable? Yes — doctors study this and test it carefully.]"
- "Someone says 'I ate carrots every day and I never got sick, so carrots prevent sickness.' [Is one person enough evidence? No — that's an anecdote, not data.]"

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction: What's the difference between a guess and evidence?** (3-4 min):
   "Before we look at something, we might think we know the answer. That's a guess — it's okay to guess! But if we want to *know*, we need to test it and look at what actually happens." Hold up two balls (one large, one small). "Which one will roll farther? Let's write down our guess before we test it — then we'll see if we were right."

2. **Claim Testing** (8-10 min):
   For each object pair, follow the same structure:
   - State a claim together: "I claim the smooth surface makes things roll farther."
   - Make a prediction (write or draw it)
   - Test it: roll an object down the ramp on smooth floor, then on a towel
   - Observe what actually happened
   - Compare: "Was our claim true? What does the evidence show?"

   Emphasize: "Notice that we're not just guessing anymore — we tested it. Now we have evidence." Point out when intuition was wrong: "We thought the big ball would roll farther, but the small ball did! Our guess wasn't right. That's why testing matters — sometimes things surprise us."

3. **Source Check Game** (7-8 min):
   Draw one Source Card at a time. Read it together. For each, ask:
   - "Who is saying this? What do they know about it?"
   - "Could they be biased — wanting us to believe something for a reason?"
   - "Is this one example or many examples?"
   - "How could we check whether this is true?"

   Guide them through: The TV commercial is biased — the company wants money. The doctor is more reliable because doctors study and test ideas. The "carrots prevent sickness" story is an anecdote — one person's experience isn't enough to conclude a pattern. "We'd need to study many people who eat carrots and many who don't and compare their sickness rates."

   For the "friend says this block is heavier" card — demonstrate: "Instead of just trusting our friend, let's weigh them and find out ourselves. That's how we actually know."

4. **The Big Idea** (3-4 min):
   "Evaluating information means asking three questions: Who is saying this and what do they know? What's the evidence — not just a guess or one story, but actual testing? And could we test it ourselves to check?"

   Real-world examples they can understand: "When a new medicine might help sick people, scientists test it on many people and compare to people who didn't take it — before they say it works. They don't just take one person's word for it."

5. **Wrap-up** (2 min):
   Review the vocabulary: claim, evidence, source, bias, experiment. Ask: "What's the difference between a claim and evidence?" (A claim says it's true; evidence is what you find when you actually look.)

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus entirely on the claim-testing component. State a claim, make a physical prediction (point to which one you think will roll farther), and test it together. Use words: "Let's find out" and "Look what actually happened!" The key concept is: we don't just assume — we look and test. Use one vocabulary word consistently: "evidence" — "Let's look at the evidence." Toddlers understand this more than we expect when it's concrete and physical.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce the source check game. Kids this age already intuitively understand that some people know more about things than others. Ask: "If you wanted to know how to fix a broken toy, would you ask your friend who's never fixed a toy, or a grownup who fixes things a lot?" Build to: "Why might a company say their cereal is healthy?" (They want you to buy it.) Introduce "bias" as a word: "When someone might want us to believe something for their own reasons, we call that bias." Let them identify bias in made-up advertising scenarios.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: The "One vs. Many" Game**
Introduce the concept that one example isn't enough. "Sam touched a dog and it didn't bite. Does that mean dogs never bite?" "It rained on Monday. Does that mean it always rains on Monday?" Contrast with: "We tested 10 objects on both surfaces and all 10 went farther on the smooth one — that's a real pattern." The lesson: conclusions need patterns, not single examples.

**Variation 2: Spot the Bias**
Collect 3-4 toy advertisements or cereal box claims. Read them together and ask: "Who made this? What do they want from us? Does that affect what they're saying?" This is age-appropriate media literacy and directly applies the vocabulary.

**Variation 3: Ask the Expert**
Identify who the right "source" is for different types of questions. "If I want to know if a plant is safe to eat, who should I ask — a chef, a botanist (plant scientist), or a firefighter?" Walk through several scenarios. The concept: expertise is domain-specific. Being good at one thing doesn't make you reliable about everything.

**Repeat play**: Apply the three questions (Who says it? What's the evidence? Could we check?) informally to everyday claims: "The weather forecast says it will rain. How do meteorologists know that?" "The box says this juice is healthy. What's the evidence?"

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child simply accepts everything an adult says without questioning

**Solution**: This is developmentally normal and not a problem — young children appropriately rely on trusted adults. The goal isn't to make children skeptical of caregivers but to introduce the framework that *beliefs need reasons*. Model it yourself: "I think the big one will roll farther — but let's test it and see." When you're wrong, say so: "I was wrong! The evidence showed something different. That happens."

**Challenge**: Child gets confused between healthy skepticism and blanket disbelief

**Solution**: Distinguish: skepticism means asking for evidence, not automatic rejection. "A skeptic doesn't say 'I don't believe anything.' A skeptic says 'show me the evidence.'" A good doctor asking to see test results before prescribing medicine is a skeptic — that's responsible.

**Challenge**: The "source check" feels abstract

**Solution**: Use their existing intuitions. "If you had a tummy ache, would you rather have a doctor look at you, or get advice from someone who's never gone to medical school?" They already understand that some people know more. That's the foundation.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Hypothesis Habit**: Before everyday events, practice: "What do you think will happen? Why?" After: "What actually happened? Was your prediction right?" Even 30-second informal predictions at meals ("I think the ice cube will melt in 5 minutes") build the habit.

2. **Reading Critically**: While reading books together, occasionally ask: "Is this something that could really happen? What's the evidence in the story?" Or for non-fiction: "How does the author know this?" Introduce the concept that even books can be wrong.

3. **Scientific Vocabulary in Daily Life**: When something unexpected happens, say "Interesting — let's look at the evidence" instead of guessing. When someone says something surprising, ask "How do they know that?" — model the evaluative question naturally.
