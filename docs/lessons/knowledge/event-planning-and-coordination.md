# Knowledge, Skills & Culture: Event Planning and Coordination

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces children to the basics of planning and organizing a simple event, such as a birthday celebration, picnic, or family gathering. Children will learn to think about sequencing, roles, and coordination by helping to prepare for a pretend party or special gathering, discovering that planning involves choosing guests, decorations, activities, and refreshments.

## Vocabulary

**Coordinate**: To organize different people and tasks so they work together smoothly. When we coordinate a party, we make sure each person knows what to do so everything happens at the right time.

**Sequence**: The order in which things happen one after another. When planning an event, we think about the sequence: first we send invitations, then we decorate, then we prepare food, and finally guests arrive.

**Collaborate**: To work together with others toward a shared goal. When we collaborate on planning a party, everyone helps with different tasks to make it special.

**Delegate**: To assign tasks to different people based on what they can do. A good event planner delegates jobs—one person sets up decorations, another arranges food, another greets guests.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

**Tempo**: Moderate and cheerful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 4 lines each):

*Verse 1*
Planning, planning parties fun
We invite the friends we love
We find decorations bright
Planning brings us joy and cheer

*Verse 2*
Now we've planned our special day
Now each task gets done with cheer
We all celebrate with glee
And we planned this happily

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. On "Planning, planning parties fun"—make a thinking gesture with finger on chin, then spread arms wide as if showing a big space
2. On "We invite the friends we love"—wave hand in a friendly greeting, then bring both hands to heart
3. On "We find decorations bright"—point around the room as if spotting decorations, then clap hands with excitement
4. On "celebrate with glee"—jump up and down with arms raised, then spin around once

## Activity

### Activity Overview

In this hands-on experience, children will help plan and prepare for a pretend party or special gathering. They'll make invitations, choose or create decorations, arrange a space, and set up refreshments. This concrete, sequential activity teaches planning, organization, and the satisfaction of working toward a shared goal.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on project with role-play and collaborative planning

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper and crayons or markers for making invitations
- Simple decorations (colored paper, tape, string, or balloons if available)
- Child-friendly snacks or treats (crackers, fruit, juice, or pretend food items)
- A space to set up (small table or corner of the room)
- Simple place cards or name tags (optional)

**Optional**:
- Pretend plates, cups, or utensils (toy dishes)
- Music for background ambiance
- Camera to document the planned space
- Checklist poster with pictures showing planning steps

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (using items you have at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Set up a designated table or area where the party will "happen"
2. Gather materials and lay them out within child's reach
3. Have a few stuffed animals or dolls available to represent "guests"

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (3-4 min):
   - Gather the child and say: "Today we're going to plan a special party! Let's think about what we need to do first."
   - Show a simple picture sequence or checklist: Invite → Decorate → Arrange Food → Celebrate
   - Ask: "Who should we invite to our party? What will we need to do to get ready?"
   - Introduce the idea that planning means doing things in order, assigning jobs, and working together

2. **Exploration** (10-15 min):
   - **Create Invitations** (5 min): Help the child draw or write simple invitations on paper (e.g., "You are invited to our party!"). Talk about why invitations matter and let the child decorate them.
   - **Choose Decorations** (5 min): Show available materials and ask: "What colors will make our party special?" Help the child arrange decorations around the space and talk about placement.
   - **Set Up Refreshments** (3-5 min): Help the child arrange snacks on a table or designated area. Talk about the steps: "First we choose what to serve, then we put it on the table, then we make it look nice."

3. **Discovery** (3 min):
   - Ask reflection questions: "What did we do first? What came next? Who helped?"
   - Point out: "Look what we've organized! Our party is ready! Do you think your guests will be surprised?"
   - Celebrate the child's planning: "You remembered everything—invitations, decorations, food, and a place to sit!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   - Have the child "welcome" stuffed animal guests to the planned space
   - Say: "You are a great event planner! You thought about what makes a party special."
   - Sing one verse of the planning song together or transition to dramatic play with the created materials

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Simplify to 2-3 key steps: decorate, arrange food, welcome guests
- Provide pre-made decorations and let the child choose where to place them
- Keep the guest list very small (2-3 stuffed animals)
- Use real, simple snacks rather than pretend items
- Focus on the sensory experience of arranging and celebrating
- Use very familiar event types (birthday, picnic)

**3-4+ years**:
- Include full planning sequence: invitations, decorations, food prep, setup, then celebration
- Have the child create decorations from scratch
- Introduce simple role cards showing each person's job
- Discuss timing: "What happens first? What happens next?"
- Ask the child to explain their planning decisions
- Create a simple checklist and mark off each task as it's completed
- Plan additional elements like games, music, or a welcome sign
- Make invitations with more detail (time, date, what to bring)

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Themed Party**: Plan a party with a specific theme (dinosaur party, princess party, construction party). Let the child choose the theme and design decorations accordingly.

**Variation 2 - Invite Real Guests**: After practicing with stuffed animals, plan a small real gathering (snack time with a sibling, tea party with a grandparent). Let the child take the lead on invitations, decoration, and welcome.

**Variation 3 - Restaurant or Cafe Planning**: Plan a pretend restaurant opening with a menu, table decorations, place cards, and background music. Extends planning into dramatic play.

**Repeat Play**: Adapt the activity for different occasions (holiday party, first-day-of-school celebration, goodbye-to-summer party). Keep the same planning structure but change the theme and decorations.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: The child becomes overwhelmed by too many steps or decisions.
**Solution**: Break the planning into just 2-3 main tasks instead of five. Use a visual checklist with pictures so the child can see progress. Offer choices ("Do you want to decorate with blue or red?") rather than open-ended options.

**Challenge**: The child struggles with the concept of sequence or "what comes next."
**Solution**: Create a simple picture sequence on a poster (draw or print images showing: write invitation → decorate → arrange food → welcome friends → celebrate). Point to each step as you do it. Use language like "First we..., then we..., after that we..."

**Challenge**: The child wants to skip steps or rush through the planning.
**Solution**: Gently slow down by asking questions: "Wait, have we sent out the invitations yet?" or "Our guests won't know where to come! Should we make a sign?" This helps the child see why each step matters.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Plan a Real Snack Time**: Use the same steps to plan when a family member will visit. Invite them formally with a handmade card, decorate the table, prepare snacks, and greet them at the door.

2. **Role-Play Different Events**: Plan a pretend wedding, graduation, picnic, or classroom celebration. Discuss how planning is similar but what changes based on the type of event.

3. **Event Planning in Daily Life**: When a birthday or holiday is coming, involve the child in the actual planning. Let them help choose decorations, make a guest list, or prepare simple foods.

4. **Create Real Invitations**: Help the child make and deliver real invitations to someone special. Discuss what information should be included (who, when, where).

5. **Photograph and Remember**: Take photos of the planned space and look at them together later. Talk about what went well and what the child might do differently next time.
