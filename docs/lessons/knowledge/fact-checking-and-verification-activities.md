# Knowledge, Skills & Culture: Fact-Checking and Verification Activities

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces young learners to foundational fact-checking skills through hands-on observation and testing. Children will explore the exciting concept of discovering whether something is true by looking closely, asking questions, and testing their ideas—the building blocks of critical thinking and scientific thinking.

## Vocabulary

**Verify**: To check if something is true or real by looking carefully or testing it. When you verify something, you're being a detective, looking for clues to see if an idea is correct—like checking if a toy really floats by putting it in water.

**Observation**: Noticing details carefully by using your eyes, ears, nose, hands, and sometimes taste. When you observe, you're being a scientist, paying close attention to how things look, sound, feel, and even smell—like noticing that some leaves are smooth and some are bumpy.

**Evidence**: Real clues or proof that help us know something is true. Evidence is what we discover when we look closely and test things—like seeing a wet puddle as evidence that it rained, or tasting salt on our fingers as evidence that we have salt on our hands.

**Prediction**: A guess or idea about what might happen next based on what you know. When you make a prediction, you're using your brain to think ahead—like guessing that a ball will bounce when you drop it, or that ice will melt when you hold it in your warm hand.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Cheerful and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
We can verify what's true
By observation too
With evidence we find
Predictions on our mind
Here's a clue, there's a clue
Testing everything we do
Fact checking helps us learn today

*Verse 2*
We observe with careful eyes
Looking for the truth inside
With evidence so clear
Predictions far and near
See it here, feel it there
Verification everywhere
Fact checking is the best way

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. On "verify"—make checkmark gesture with hand

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children become "fact checkers" by testing simple statements about objects and materials around them. They'll develop observation skills and learn that we can discover what's true by looking carefully, feeling, testing, and asking questions. This hands-on exploration builds confidence in their ability to investigate and think critically.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on discovery and testing activity

**Duration**: 12-18 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- 3-4 common household objects (wooden spoon, plastic cup, sponge, apple, toy car, ball)
- Water in a shallow bowl or tray
- A safe surface for testing (table or floor)

**Optional**:
- Magnifying glass (toy or real)
- Items with different textures (sandpaper, velvet, plastic wrap)
- Notebook or picture journal to record findings
- Camera or phone to photograph discoveries

**Cost**: Free (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Gather 3-4 common objects and place them on a low table or floor where the child can reach them easily
2. Fill a shallow bowl with water and place it nearby on a protected surface
3. Clear the area of hazards and ensure good lighting for observation
4. Wash hands and demonstrate curiosity and excitement about discovery

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):

   Start with enthusiasm: "Today we're going to be fact checkers! That means we're going to test ideas and discover what's true. Let's see if our guesses are right!"

   Show one object: "I think this [sponge] will float in water. Do you think it will float or sink? Let's test it together and see what's true!"

2. **Exploration** (7-10 min):

   For each object, follow this sequence:

   - **Make a prediction**: "What do you think will happen if we put this in the water? Will it float or sink? Will it get wet? Will it feel soft or hard?"

   - **Test it**: Place the object in water and observe together. Say: "Let's watch and see what really happens. What do you notice?"

   - **Gather evidence**: Point out what you see: "Look! The sponge floated! That means our guess was right. Can you feel how it absorbed the water? That's evidence—proof—that sponges soak up water."

   - **Feel and examine**: Let the child touch the object before and after (if safe). Ask: "Is it the same? What changed? What stayed the same?"

   - **Ask questions together**: "Why do you think that happened? What else could we try?"

3. **Discovery** (2-3 min):

   Sit together and reflect: "You were excellent fact checkers today! You looked carefully, you tested your ideas, and you discovered what was true. Did anything surprise you?"

   Point out the process: "We made guesses, then we tested them. That's how we know what's true. Scientists do this too!"

4. **Wrap-up** (1-2 min):

   Acknowledge their work: "You asked great questions and found lots of evidence. That makes you a real fact checker!"

   Transition: "Let's wash our hands and think about what we discovered."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:

- Use simpler language: "Will it sink or float?" instead of "What do you predict?"
- Focus on ONE object and test it repeatedly with different outcomes (float in water, drop on floor, etc.)
- Make predictions very concrete: "This ball bounces. Watch!" Then bounce it. Then ask: "Does it bounce again?"
- Accept short answers and pointing as participation
- Use all five senses safely: let them touch, smell, listen (not taste unless food item)
- Keep testing to 5-7 minutes maximum

**3-4+ years**:

- Introduce vocabulary: "Let's verify whether this is true by testing it"
- Test multiple objects and compare: "Which ones float? Which ones sink? Why?"
- Record observations by drawing pictures or dictating descriptions
- Ask deeper questions: "What would happen if...? Why do you think...? How could we test that?"
- Introduce simple cause-and-effect: "The sponge soaked up water because sponges are made to absorb water"
- Create an "evidence board" with pictures or drawings of discoveries
- Test predictions multiple times to verify consistency

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Sink or Float Sorting**: Create two areas (sink and float). After testing objects, sort them into the correct group. Challenge: "Can you predict where each one goes before we test it?"

**Variation 2 - Texture Investigation**: Use items with different textures (smooth stone, bumpy pinecone, soft cloth, rough sandpaper). Predict: "Which one will feel soft?" Test by touching and comparing. Create texture rubbings with paper and crayons.

**Variation 3 - Sound Investigation**: Gather objects that make different sounds (wooden spoon, metal spoon, plastic cup, bell). Predict: "Which one makes the loudest sound?" Test by tapping and comparing. Create a simple sound chart with pictures.

**Repeat play**: Change the objects each session. Keep asking predictions and testing. Over time, children begin predicting more accurately as they build evidence from repeated testing.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to taste everything or put objects in mouth.

**Solution**: This is normal at age 2-3. Use only safe, food-safe objects when possible (fruit, safe toys). Redirect: "We look at this one and feel it, but we taste only the apple." Establish clear boundaries about what can go in the mouth. Keep testing to foods and clearly marked safe objects.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest after testing one object and wants to move on.

**Solution**: Follow the child's lead. They don't need to test everything. Quality over quantity. One deeply explored discovery is better than rushing through multiple objects. Come back to this activity another day with fresh enthusiasm.

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated if their prediction is "wrong."

**Solution**: Reframe immediately and positively: "You guessed it would sink, and it floated! That's so interesting! That's how we learn—we test our ideas and discover something new!" Make it about discovery, not right or wrong answers. Celebrate curiosity over accuracy.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't want to predict; they just want to do the activity.

**Solution**: That's fine! Skip the prediction step for younger children. Let them test, explore, and observe. The prediction skill develops naturally over time. You can gently introduce it: "What might happen?" but don't force it.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Fact-Checking at Mealtime**: At lunch, make simple statements: "Crackers are hard. Let's test it!" Eat one and verify. "Applesauce is soft. Is that true?" This brings fact-checking into daily routines.

2. **Nature Verification Walk**: Outside, make predictions about nature: "Do you think this leaf will float?" "Is this rock hard?" Test your ideas on a walk. Collect evidence (interesting findings) in a small bag.

3. **Photo Documentation**: Take pictures of your tests and discoveries. Create a simple poster: "We Were Fact Checkers! Here's What We Discovered." Display it proudly to reinforce the learning.
