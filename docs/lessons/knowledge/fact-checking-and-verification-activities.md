# Knowledge, Skills & Culture: Fact-Checking and Verification Activities

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces young learners to the foundations of fact-checking and verification through hands-on observation and testing. Children will explore how humans distinguish true claims from false ones — using evidence, repeated testing, and corroboration — the same processes used by scientists, journalists, and historians. The lesson builds real epistemological habits: asking "how do we know?" and recognizing that some methods of knowing are more reliable than others.

## Vocabulary

**Hypothesis**: A specific, testable idea about what is true and why. Scientists don't just guess randomly — a hypothesis is an educated prediction based on what you already know. "I think the sponge will float because it has lots of tiny air holes inside" is a hypothesis; "maybe it will float" is just a guess.

**Empirical**: Based on direct observation and testing, not just opinion or memory. Empirical evidence is what you can actually see, measure, or test. When you put the sponge in water and watch what happens, you're gathering empirical evidence.

**Verify**: To confirm something is true by checking it against evidence. Verification means not just guessing or remembering — it means testing. Scientists verify by repeating experiments; fact-checkers verify by consulting multiple sources.

**Corroborate**: When two or more different pieces of evidence point to the same conclusion. If the sponge floats AND you can feel air bubbles inside it, those two observations corroborate each other — they support the same explanation.

**Bias**: A tendency to see or believe what you already expect, even when the evidence says otherwise. Everyone has biases. A good fact-checker notices when they want something to be true and checks even harder.

**Observation**: Carefully noticing details using your senses — sight, sound, touch, smell. Good observations are specific: not "it got wet" but "it absorbed water and became heavier and squishier."

**Evidence**: Concrete, observable information that supports or contradicts a claim. Not all evidence is equal — direct observation is stronger evidence than someone else's memory.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Cheerful and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
We can verify what's true
With evidence we view
A hypothesis we make
Then test it for goodness' sake
Check it here, check it there
Empirical everywhere
Fact-checking helps us learn today

*Verse 2*
Two clues that agree — corroborate!
Bias wants us just to wait
We test again to see
What the evidence will be
Look and feel, touch and smell
Observation serves us well
Evidence shows us what is true

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. On "verify" — make checkmark gesture with hand
2. On "hypothesis" — tap head, then point forward
3. On "empirical" — cup hands around eyes like binoculars
4. On "corroborate" — bring two fists together in front of chest
5. On "bias" — shade eyes with one hand (blocking view)
6. On "evidence" — open hands palms up, as if presenting something

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children become "fact detectives" by testing specific claims about objects and materials. Unlike simple exploration, each test follows a structured process: state a claim, form a hypothesis about why it might be true, gather empirical evidence, and check whether two types of evidence corroborate each other. This builds the actual cognitive habits of verification — not just curiosity, but disciplined inquiry.

**Activity Type**: Structured hands-on investigation with explicit reasoning steps

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- 4-5 common household objects (wooden spoon, plastic cup, sponge, apple, toy car, coin, cork)
- Water in a shallow bowl or tray
- A safe surface for testing (table or floor)

**Optional**:
- Magnifying glass (toy or real)
- Simple two-column recording sheet (draw checkmark/X columns)
- Camera or phone to photograph discoveries
- Kitchen scale or balance (to feel relative weight)

**Cost**: Free (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Gather 4-5 objects and place them where the child can reach them easily
2. Fill a shallow bowl with water and place it on a protected surface
3. Prepare simple claim cards (written or pictured): "This will float," "This is heavy," "This will absorb water"
4. Clear the area of hazards and ensure good lighting

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction: What is a Claim?** (2-3 min)

   Introduce the concept: "A claim is something someone says is true. But how do we KNOW if it's really true? We can't just believe it — we have to check! That's called verification."

   Hold up a sponge: "I claim this sponge will float. That's what I think is true. But thinking isn't the same as knowing. How can we find out for sure?"

   Introduce hypothesis: "Before we test, let's make a hypothesis — that means we think about WHY it might be true. I think sponges float because they have tiny holes filled with air inside. Let's test it and see."

2. **Structured Investigation** (10-12 min)

   For each object, follow this explicit verification sequence:

   - **State the claim**: "I claim this [object] will [float/sink/absorb water]."

   - **Form a hypothesis**: "I think this because..." (Help them reason: "The coin is metal and heavy, so I think it might sink. Metal is denser than water — that means more material packed into the same space.")

   - **Gather empirical evidence**: Place object in water. Say: "We're gathering empirical evidence now — that means evidence we can actually see and test ourselves, not just what someone told us."

   - **Look for corroboration**: Find two pieces of evidence that point to the same conclusion. "The coin sank AND when I hold it, it feels much heavier than the cork. Both pieces of evidence tell us the same thing about density."

   - **Verdict**: "Was the claim true or false? How do we know? What evidence do we have?"

   - **Watch for bias**: "Did we want the sponge to float because we thought it would? Did that make us look for evidence that it floated and ignore evidence that it might not? Good fact-checkers watch out for that."

3. **The "Two Sources" Challenge** (3-4 min)

   Introduce corroboration as a skill: "Fact-checkers don't trust just one piece of evidence. They look for two or more pieces that agree."

   Pick the sponge. Ask for two different ways to verify it absorbs water:
   - Squeeze it after removing from water (you can feel the water inside)
   - Hold it over the bowl and watch water drip out

   "Both pieces of evidence agree — the sponge absorbed water. When two different observations tell us the same thing, that's called corroboration. Now we're more confident the claim is true."

4. **Wrap-up: How Do We Know?** (1-2 min)

   Ask the big question: "How do WE know these things are true? Not because someone told us. Not because we guessed. Because we tested, observed, and found corroborating evidence. That's how scientists know things, and now it's how YOU know things."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:

- Use "test it" instead of "verify," but say both: "Let's test it — that means verify it."
- Focus on ONE object tested two different ways (the corroboration concept in simplified form)
- Make the hypothesis very concrete: "I think it floats because it's light. Let's check!"
- Accept pointing and one-word answers as participation ("yes," "no," "sank")
- Celebrate when predictions are WRONG: "Ooh, we learned something! That's even better!"
- Keep to 8-10 minutes maximum

**3-4+ years**:

- Use full vocabulary: hypothesis, empirical, corroborate, verify
- Encourage the child to state the claim AND the hypothesis before testing
- Introduce bias explicitly: "I really wanted this to float. Did that make me look for different evidence?"
- Record findings by drawing or dictating: "Draw what happened when we tested the coin"
- Introduce the idea that "one test isn't enough" — repeat the same test twice to verify consistency
- Ask: "If we tested it 10 times, would it always sink? Why?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Contradiction Detection**: State a claim that is obviously false. "I claim this rock is lighter than the feather." Test it. Say: "The evidence contradicts the claim — it says the opposite is true. Evidence can prove things false as well as true."

**Variation 2 - Memory vs. Testing**: Ask the child to remember something ("Was the apple heavier or lighter than the cork?"), then actually test it. Compare memory against empirical evidence. "Our memories aren't always reliable — that's why we test."

**Variation 3 - Corroboration Challenge**: Choose one object and find THREE different ways to test the same claim. Each new observation that agrees is more corroboration. "The more evidence that points the same direction, the more confident we can be."

**Repeat play**: Vary the objects and the claims. Introduce new vocabulary over time. Over weeks, children begin to naturally ask "How do we know?" and "What's the evidence?" — which are genuinely powerful epistemological habits.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to taste everything or put objects in mouth.

**Solution**: This is normal at age 2-3. Use only safe, food-safe objects when possible (fruit, safe toys). Redirect: "We look at this one and feel it, but we taste only the apple." Establish clear boundaries about what can go in the mouth.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest after testing one object.

**Solution**: Follow the child's lead. One deeply explored claim — with a hypothesis, two pieces of evidence, and a corroboration — is better than rushing through five objects. The intellectual structure is the learning, not the quantity of tests.

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated when their prediction is "wrong."

**Solution**: Reframe immediately: "Your hypothesis wasn't supported by the evidence — that means we LEARNED something! Scientists are actually excited when they're wrong, because it means they discovered something they didn't know before." This is factually true and builds genuine scientific mindset.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't want to explain WHY before testing.

**Solution**: Model it yourself. State your own hypothesis out loud before each test. Over time, children absorb the habit of reasoning before testing. Don't force it, but demonstrate that it's a normal part of the process.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Fact-Checking at Mealtime**: Make a specific, testable claim at lunch: "I claim this apple slice will float in my water cup." Form a hypothesis, test it, and verify. Brings the full verification process into daily life.

2. **The Memory Test**: Ask the child to remember what happened in a book or earlier in the day, then check: look at the book again, or look at photos. Compare memory to the "record." "Memory is evidence, but it's not always reliable — checking is better."

3. **Two-Source Rule**: When the child states something as fact ("Dinosaurs were bigger than houses!"), gently ask: "How do we know? What's our evidence? Can we find two sources — a book AND a picture — that corroborate each other?" This models the real practice of verification.
