## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**Setting expectations**:
- "We're going to look at photos and learn stories about your family"

### Main Activity (15-25 minutes)

**Phase 1: Photo Exploration and Stories** (5-8 minutes)

**Phase 2: Interview and Recording** (5-10 minutes)
Child practices as family historian

- Child listens carefully and draws what they hear
- Record family member's response (audio or written)
- Invite child to ask their own follow-up questions
- Share 2-3 stories from different family members if possible

**Phase 3: Creating Family Connection** (remaining time)
Child expresses understanding through family tree

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:

- Share: "You're part of this big family with so many interesting people"
- Ask: "What did you learn about your family? Who's a favorite person in your family?"
- Celebrate: "You're a great family historian!"

**Transition to cleanup**:
- Child helps organize photos carefully
- Discuss displaying the family tree: "Where should we put this?"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Approach**:
Focus on immediate family (parents, siblings, grandparents) and very simple concepts. Use photos heavily and keep stories brief and concrete. Emphasize immediate relationships and simple connections.

**Key modifications**:
- Stick to 3-4 close family members you see regularly
- Very short, simple stories: "This is Grandma. She gives hugs."
- Ask child to point to family members in photos
- Simple family tree with just immediate family (parents, grandparents, self)
- Emphasize who lives with child and who they see often
- Child's role is to observe and point; you create the tree

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Adult support**: High - you tell stories and create the tree; child identifies people and listens

### 3-4+ years
**Extensions**:
Include extended family and ancestors. Encourage more independence in asking questions. Add details like names, places of origin, and characteristics. Create more elaborate family trees.

**Additional techniques**:
- Interview more family members
- Child helps draw the family tree connections
- Add written labels and names to the tree
- Discuss where family came from (city, country, cultural heritage)
- Ask: "What makes your family special? What do they like to do?"
- Create symbols for professions or characteristics (teacher, gardener, storyteller)
- Extend to previous generations if interested

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes; may become multi-session project

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Cultural Heritage Exploration**
Focus on family traditions, foods, celebrations, or cultural practices. Interview family members about their heritage and create a "cultural customs" chart showing what makes your family unique.

**Variation 2: Timeline Creation**
Create a timeline of family events: when parents met, when children were born, family moves, celebrations. Add illustrations and photos in chronological order.

**Variation 3: "About Me" Biography**
Turn the focus back to the child as part of the family story. Create a book about "Me and My Family" with drawings and stories about what makes the child special and their place in the family.

**Variation 4: Ancestral Traditions**
Explore specific family traditions across generations. Create an illustrated guide to how the family celebrates holidays, makes special foods, or marks important occasions.

**Thematic variations**:
- Immigration stories: Where did your family come from before here?
- Profession exploration: What different jobs do family members do?
- Holiday celebrations: How does your family celebrate special days?
- Family talents: What is each family member good at?

## Cultural Context

**Why this activity matters in human culture**:
Family history and genealogy are fundamental to human identity and belonging across all cultures. From formal genealogies in royal families to oral history traditions passed down through generations to modern ancestry research, humans have always maintained connection to their roots and heritage. This activity honors the universal human need to understand where we come from and how we belong to something larger than ourselves.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Learn about different family structures around the world (extended families, multi-generational homes, adoptive families)
- Explore how different cultures pass down family stories and histories
- Discuss how families celebrate heritage and maintain traditions
- Recognize that all families are unique and valuable in different ways
- Explore cultural practices related to honoring ancestors or remembering family

**Resources**:
- "All Families Are Different" by Mary Ann Hoberman
- "In Our Mothers' House" by Leslea Newman - diverse family structures
- "Abuela" by Arthur Dorros - family stories and cultural heritage
- Cultural celebration books for your family's specific traditions

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't know family members well or asks difficult questions about absent relatives
**Why**: Young children haven't developed complex understandings of family relationships or absence; they're curious but may not understand reasons.
**Solution**: Keep explanations simple, honest, and age-appropriate. Focus on those family members who are present and accessible. It's okay to say "I'll tell you more when you're older" about complex situations.

**Challenge**: Family members aren't available to interview or share stories
**Why**: Not all families have extended family accessible; single-parent families, blended families, or adopted families have different structures.
**Solution**: This is completely valid and important to represent! Work with available family. Include important non-blood family (close friends, teachers, mentors) if desired. Celebrate your family as it is.

**Challenge**: Child seems uninterested in family history or photos
**Why**: Young children's interests vary; abstract family connections may not feel relevant compared to immediate activities.
**Solution**: Don't force it. Start with what the child cares about (a favorite grandparent, a beloved pet from the past) rather than formal genealogy. Meet them where their interest is.

**Challenge**: Child asks why family members look different or comes from different ethnic/cultural background than parents
**Why**: Young children notice differences and ask genuine questions about identity and belonging.
**Solution**: This is a wonderful opening for honest, positive conversations. Explain adoption, blended families, or multi-ethnic heritage simply and matter-of-factly. Books can help explore diverse families.

### Tips for Success
- Make family stories emotionally warm and accessible - this builds connection
- Include yourself in the history - share your own childhood memories
- Use humor and light emotion when telling stories
- Keep visual aids (photos) present throughout the activity
- Make it okay to not know everything - families research and discover together
- Celebrate family uniqueness: "Every family is different, and that's what makes families interesting"
- Create a special place to keep the family tree - display it proudly

### What to Do With the Creation
- Display the family tree prominently in the home
- Photograph it before moving on for preservation
- Create copies for extended family members to share
- Add to it over time as the family grows or learns more
- Use as conversation starter: "Tell me about this person"
- Reference in future learning about family, culture, or identity
- Consider photographing and creating a digital version for safe-keeping
- Share with family members at gatherings or through mail/email
