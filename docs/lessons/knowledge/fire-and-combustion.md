# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Fire and Combustion

## Activity Summary

Children will explore the scientific concept of fire and combustion through safe, age-appropriate hands-on demonstrations and sensory exploration. This lesson teaches how fire needs three things to burn (heat, fuel, and oxygen) while developing vocabulary about heat, light, and energy transformation. Through guided observation and interactive activities, children will understand fire's role in the world while developing healthy respect for this natural phenomenon.

## Vocabulary

**Combustion**: A chemical reaction where fuel molecules break apart and combine with oxygen, releasing stored chemical energy as heat and light. The chemical equation for burning wax (a hydrocarbon) produces carbon dioxide and water vapor — the same gases you breathe out. *Example: When a candle burns, wax molecules react with oxygen to produce heat, light, CO₂, and water vapor.*

**Fire triangle**: The three things every fire requires simultaneously — fuel, heat, and oxygen. Remove any one side of the triangle and the fire goes out. Firefighters use this knowledge: sprinklers remove heat, smothering removes oxygen, removing fuel (like cutting down trees ahead of a wildfire) removes the third side.

**Fuel**: Any material that can undergo combustion — contains stored chemical energy that releases when the material reacts with oxygen. *Examples: Candle wax (a hydrocarbon), wood (cellulose), natural gas (methane), coal. Different fuels burn at different temperatures and produce different amounts of energy.*

**Oxidation**: The chemical process of combining with oxygen. Combustion is fast oxidation; rusting iron is extremely slow oxidation. Both release energy, but combustion releases it fast enough to produce visible heat and light.

**Incandescence**: The emission of visible light from a hot object. The yellow-orange part of a flame is incandescent — tiny carbon particles (soot) heated to around 1,000°C glow with visible light. The blue base of a candle flame is hotter (complete combustion, around 1,400°C) and glows from different excited molecules.

**Combustion products**: What fire produces — carbon dioxide (CO₂), water vapor (H₂O), and unburned carbon particles (smoke and soot) if combustion is incomplete. This is why candles leave black marks and why chimneys need cleaning.

**Ignition temperature**: The minimum temperature a fuel must reach before it will combust. Paper ignites around 233°C; wood around 300°C; gasoline at −43°C (which is why it ignites so easily). The match provides enough heat energy to reach ignition temperature.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Moderate

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Old MacDonald burned a flame, E-I-E-I-O,
And fire needs three things, E-I-E-I-O,
Heat and fuel with a whee,
Oxygen from air so free,
Combustion burns, E-I-E-I-O.

*Verse 2*
Heat and light and warmth come fast, E-I-E-I-O,
Fire's energy and blast, E-I-E-I-O,
We respect the flame so hot,
Safety rules cannot be forgot,
Learning fire, E-I-E-I-O!

**Actions/Gestures**:

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will safely observe a real candle flame and explore what fire needs to burn through a series of guided demonstrations. They will observe a candle flame, feel the heat from a distance, watch what happens when oxygen is removed, and discover what materials burn versus don't burn. This concrete experience builds understanding of combustion while developing scientific observation skills and healthy fire awareness.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration with guided demonstration

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- One thick pillar candle in a safe holder (or tea light candle in a container)
- Matches or long lighter (for adult use only)
- Small glass or clear container (to place over candle)
- Safe, flat, heat-resistant surface (away from curtains, papers)

**Optional**:
- Small non-flammable objects to show don't burn (plastic, metal, wet paper)
- Small combustible items to demonstrate burning (dried plant material, paper, cardboard)
- Thermometer (to show temperature change near flame)
- Camera or phone to document observations
- Small fan or your own breath to show oxygen's role
- Colored tissue paper to show flame movement

**Cost**: Free to $3 (candle likely already at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Set up candle on heat-resistant surface at least 3 feet away from any flammable materials (curtains, papers, cloth)
2. Have a water-filled bowl or fire extinguisher nearby as a safety precaution
3. Establish a clear boundary (tape or masking tape circle) where children must stay during activity
4. Test the glass container to ensure it fits over the candle safely
5. Ensure good ventilation in the room
6. Brief children on fire safety rules before beginning

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   - Gather children safely around the candle area within your marked boundary
   - Say: "Today we're going to be fire scientists! We're going to watch fire very carefully and learn what it needs to live."
   - Ask: "What do you think fire needs to burn? Can it burn all by itself, or does it need something?" (Pause for responses)
   - Explain: "Fire is amazing! It needs three special things: heat to start it, fuel to burn, and oxygen from the air. Let's discover this together!"

2. **Exploration** (8-10 minutes):

   **Part A - Observe the Flame** (2-3 min):
   - Light the candle slowly and carefully, narrating as you do: "Now I'm giving the candle heat energy with the match — enough to reach the wax's ignition temperature. Watch what happens..."
   - Once lit, ask children to observe: "What do you see? What colors do you notice? What shape is it? Does it move?"
   - Point out the different flame zones: "See the very bottom — it's blue! That's the hottest part, where complete combustion happens, around 1,400 degrees. The yellow-orange middle glow is from tiny carbon particles — bits of wax that didn't fully burn — glowing from heat. That's called incandescence, like a glowing ember."
   - Add: "The invisible part above is hot gases rising — carbon dioxide and water vapor, the combustion products. Fire uses up the wax and produces CO₂ and water vapor as it burns."

   **Part B - Feel the Heat Energy** (2-3 min):
   - Hold your hand (or the child's hand with permission) about 12 inches above the flame
   - Ask: "Do you feel warmth coming down? That's heat energy traveling through the air from the fire!"
   - Move hand closer and farther to show heat intensity changes: "See how it's hotter when we're closer? That's more heat energy reaching us!"
   - Explain: "This is one thing fire needs - heat energy to keep burning"

   **Part C - Show Oxygen's Role** (2-3 min):
   - Say: "Now let's see something amazing. Fire needs oxygen from the air, just like we breathe oxygen. What happens if we take the oxygen away?"
   - Slowly place the glass container over the candle
   - Watch together as the flame dims and eventually goes out
   - Ask: "What happened? The flame is smaller... smaller... and now it's gone! Why? Because we blocked the air - the oxygen - from reaching the fire!"
   - Remove the container: "Now let's give it oxygen again..." The flame reignites or you can relight it
   - Explain: "That's amazing! Fire needs oxygen to keep burning. That's our third thing!"

   **Part D - Discuss Fuel** (1-2 min):
   - Point to the candle wax: "See this? The wax is the fuel. The fuel is what actually burns. As the wax melts and burns, it gets used up. Eventually the whole candle will be gone!"
   - Show the melted wax pool: "See how the wax is melting? That's from the heat energy. The flame is eating the wax as fuel."

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):

   Ask guiding questions to deepen understanding:
   - "What are the three things fire needs to burn?" (Heat, fuel, oxygen)
   - "Where did the heat come from to start our candle?" (The match gave it heat)
   - "Where does the oxygen come from that fire needs?" (From the air around us)
   - "What would happen if we lived somewhere with no oxygen?" (Fire couldn't burn)
   - "What other things burn like our candle? Can you think of campfires, stoves, or the sun?"

   Point out observations:
   - The flame color and why it varies (different temperatures)
   - The smoke rising (that's hot gases going up)
   - The flickering motion (the flame moves as air moves around it)
   - The way the candle wax melts into a pool

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):

   - Carefully blow out the candle together (or let it continue burning while supervised)
   - As it goes out, say: "When we blew it out, we blew away the heat and the oxygen. Without those, the fire couldn't keep going!"
   - Review key concepts: "Today we learned that fire needs three things: heat energy, fuel, and oxygen. When all three are together, we get combustion - that's when things burn!"
   - Transition: "We're fire scientists now! Whenever you see a candle, a fireplace, or even the sun, you can remember what we learned about combustion!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use only a tea light candle or votive candle (smaller, less intense)
- Keep children further away (at least 2 feet from flame)
- Use real words alongside simple explanations: say "combustion" and then "that means burning," say "oxygen" and then "a gas in the air." Don't replace real terms with only everyday words — introduce both.
- Focus primarily on observation: watching the flame move and change color
- Keep the glass container demo very brief (children have shorter attention spans)
- Don't attempt to relight the candle multiple times - one demo per session
- Make it multi-sensory: emphasize what they see (flame color), hear (crackling), and feel (warmth from a safe distance)
- For fuel: "the candle gets used up as it burns — the wax is the fuel, the thing the fire eats"

**3-4+ years**:
- Use a standard pillar candle or larger candle for better visibility
- Children can stand closer (12-18 inches) with close supervision
- Introduce full vocabulary: combustion, fuel, oxygen, heat energy
- Conduct multiple demonstrations: flame under glass, flame with air flow, comparing different candle sizes
- Ask more complex "why" questions: Why does the flame point up? Why is some of it blue?
- Invite children to make predictions: "What do you think will happen if I blow on the flame?"
- Discuss safety more thoroughly: "Why can't you touch the flame? Why does it need grown-ups nearby?"
- Extend to other examples: How does a stove work? What about a fireplace?
- Show the wax melting and dripping, discuss where the wax goes (evaporation)

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Temperature Experiment**: Place a thermometer near (but not touching) the candle flame. Measure the temperature from different distances. Even young children can see the numbers change and understand "further away = less hot."

**Variation 2 - Shadow Play**: In a slightly darkened room, use the candle flame to create shadows with objects. Show how the flame is a light source and casts shadows like the sun does. Discuss: "Fire gives us light energy, just like the sun!"

**Variation 3 - Different Fuels**: Show (but don't burn) different fuel types: candle wax, wood pieces, paper, dried leaves. Discuss: "All of these could be fuel for fire. They would all burn and release heat and light energy."

**Variation 4 - Flame Painting**: Use the candlelight to look at how light moves and changes. Draw or trace shadows. Show how the flame color changes at different heights (blue at base, yellow in middle, orange at tip).

**Variation 5 - Cook Something with Heat**: Use the candle's heat to warm a small cup of water (from a safe distance, no boiling). Show: "The heat from fire can cook our food and warm us up. That's why we use fire in cooking!"

**Repeat play**: Change the candle size or type (pillar, taper, tea light) and observe differences. Compare flames outdoors versus indoors. Use the glass container demonstration multiple times but vary what you cover (only half the flame, then remove, etc.). Record observations in a simple picture journal.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to touch the flame or get too close

**Solution**: Set clear, firm boundaries before starting. Use a physical marker (tape line) on the ground that children cannot cross. Practice the boundary rule before lighting the candle: "The flame is hot. It will hurt us. We watch from here" (point to line). Practice having them stand at the boundary before the candle is lit. Use positive reinforcement when they follow the rule. If a child repeatedly breaks the boundary, end the activity and try again another day - safety is non-negotiable.

**Challenge**: Child is scared of the fire or the loud crackling

**Solution**: Respect their fear - it's developmentally healthy! Start with a very small candle or tea light (less intense). Let them observe from further away. You can even start by just talking about the candle without lighting it. Let them control the distance - they can move closer as they feel comfortable. The crackling sound is totally normal, so prepare them: "The fire might make a little crackling sound. That's normal and nothing to worry about." Play the candle activity in daylight first rather than dim lighting.

**Challenge**: Child wants to continue playing with fire or tries to find matches/lighters independently

**Solution**: This shows healthy curiosity! Channel it positively: "You're interested in fire - that's smart! But fire is only for grown-ups to use. You and I can observe and learn about it together, but grown-ups keep the matches safe." Establish this rule clearly: "Matches and lighters are grown-up tools. Your job is to watch and learn. My job is to be safe with them." Praise fire safety behaviors: "Great job staying back from the flame! You're being safe!"

**Challenge**: The demonstration doesn't "work" (candle won't stay lit, glass doesn't fit right, etc.)

**Solution**: Keep it simple! Even if your setup isn't perfect, the learning happens. Children learn from what actually occurs, not from a perfect demonstration. If the glass container doesn't work, just blow out the candle and relight it to show how oxygen and heat both matter. If the candle won't light, talk about what you'd do: "Sometimes matches don't work on the first try. We just try again." This is authentic science - things don't always work perfectly!

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Kitchen Fire Safety**: Point out the stove or oven as another place where combustion happens. Discuss safe practices: "The burner is hot because of combustion, like our candle. We don't touch it. Adults use it to cook." This connects learning to daily life and reinforces safety.

2. **Story Connection**: Read books about fire safety or books featuring fire (like "The Little Engine That Could" or "Where the Wild Things Are" which mentions fire). Talk about the story in terms of what you learned: "Remember how fire needs heat, fuel, and oxygen?"

3. **Sun Observation**: On a sunny day, talk about the sun as a giant fire in space: "The sun is burning like our candle, giving us heat and light. But it's SO much bigger and hotter! The combustion in the sun is what keeps us warm here on Earth."

4. **Cooking Together**: Involve children in cooking where they can safely observe heat transformation: "See how the heat from the flame is cooking our food? Heat energy from combustion is changing the food." Keep them at a safe distance but let them observe.

5. **Seasonal Connections**: In winter, discuss fireplaces or heaters. In fall, talk about harvest and fire's role. During camping season, discuss campfires: "A campfire is bigger combustion - it needs big fuel (wood), big heat, and lots of oxygen from the air around it!"
