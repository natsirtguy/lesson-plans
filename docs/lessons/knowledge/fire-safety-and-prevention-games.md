# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Fire Safety and Prevention Games

## Activity Summary

Children learn fire safety through understanding the actual science of fire — not just rules, but the reasons behind them. Why does smoke rise to the ceiling? (Thermal convection — hot air is less dense and floats up.) Why do you crawl low? (Cooler, more breathable air stays near the floor.) Why does stop, drop, and roll work? (Rolling smothers flames by cutting off their oxygen supply.) Understanding the science behind safety rules makes those rules memorable and transferable to new situations children can't anticipate.

## Vocabulary

**Combustion**: The chemical reaction that produces fire — fuel (something that can burn) combines with oxygen from the air, and heat triggers the reaction. The products are carbon dioxide, water vapor, heat, and light. If any one of those three inputs (fuel, oxygen, heat) is removed, the fire stops. This is the fire triangle.

**Thermal Convection**: Hot air rises because it's less dense than cool air. This is why smoke from a fire drifts up to the ceiling. In a burning room, the ceiling fills with hot, toxic smoke first — which is why crawling low keeps you in the cooler, more breathable air near the floor.

**Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: A colorless, odorless, toxic gas produced when fuel doesn't burn completely. Most fire deaths are actually caused by smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning, not by direct burns. This is why getting out fast matters so much.

**Stop, Drop, and Roll**: The technique for extinguishing fire on a person's clothing. Stopping prevents running from fanning the flames; dropping removes oxygen by pressing clothing against the ground; rolling smothers the fire by repeatedly cutting off its air supply. The fire triangle again — remove oxygen, fire stops.

**Flash Point**: The minimum temperature at which a material can ignite. Gasoline can ignite from a spark at room temperature (very low flash point). Wood needs much more heat. This is why some materials are much more dangerous than others near heat sources.

**Prevention**: Eliminating one or more sides of the fire triangle before they combine. Keeping fuel (paper, cloth, wood) away from heat sources. Storing flammable chemicals with tight lids. Never leaving open flames unattended. Prevention is far more effective than response.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: London Bridge Is Falling Down

**Tempo**: Slow and gentle

**Lyrics**:

*Verse 1*
Fire is hot and burns so bright, burns so bright, burns so bright,
Fire is hot and burns so bright, we must stay away.

*Verse 2*
When you see a fire, don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be scared,
When you see a fire, don't be scared, tell a grown-up fast!

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Wiggle fingers downward like flames for "fire is hot and burns so bright"
2. Put hands together in front of chest and step backward for "we must stay away"
3. Hold hand up to mouth and call out for "tell a grown-up fast"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children learn and practice fire safety through guided games, role-play scenarios, and interactive learning activities. They explore concepts like identifying hazards, understanding safe behaviors, and knowing what to do in an emergency through play-based learning that feels fun rather than scary. This hands-on approach helps children understand and remember fire safety rules they can use throughout their lives.

**Activity Type**: Safety education through dramatic play, creative games, and interactive learning

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards or drawings showing fire safety scenarios (home, kitchen, outdoor spaces) - 5-10 images
- Safe toy or props: stuffed animal, doll, toy house, or building blocks - at least 1
- Red and orange fabric scraps, construction paper, or streamers for "fire" representation - handful
- Bell or whistle for alert signals - 1
- Chart paper or poster board for creating safety rules - 1 sheet
- Markers in red, orange, black, and other colors - basic set

**Optional**:
- Firefighter costume pieces (hat, jacket, reflective vest) - adds engagement
- Picture books about fire safety ("Brave Fireman Fred", "Sparky's Safety Story")
- Safety checklist printout for home hazards
- Toy fire truck or emergency vehicle

**Cost**: Free to under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all materials and arrange in accessible locations
2. Review age-appropriate fire safety concepts, emphasizing prevention and helpful adults rather than fear
3. Prepare simple scenario cards or picture prompts (optional but helpful)
4. Ensure space is clear and safe for movement activities
5. Safety check: confirm no actual fire hazards in the activity area

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction: The fire triangle** (3-4 min):
   "Fire needs three things to burn: fuel, oxygen, and heat. If you take away any one of them, the fire stops." Draw a triangle on paper and label each side: FUEL / OXYGEN / HEAT. "Wood is fuel. Air has oxygen. A match creates heat. Put all three together and you get fire." "Firefighters use water to cool the heat — removing that side. Foam smothers oxygen — removing another side. This is why they work."

   Demonstrate: "When you blow out a birthday candle, what are you doing? You're disrupting the heat and oxygen supply — two sides of the triangle at once."

2. **Why the rules work: The science behind safety** (7-9 min):
   Explain each rule with its scientific reason:

   - **"Crawl low during a fire"**: "Smoke rises to the ceiling first — this is called thermal convection. Hot air is lighter than cold air, so it floats up. The cleanest air is near the floor." (Practice crawling together.) "That's the same reason hot air balloons fly — hot air rises."

   - **"Stop, Drop, and Roll"**: "If your clothes catch fire, what would happen if you ran? Running fans the flames with more oxygen and spreads them. Instead: STOP. DROP — get the fire away from your face. ROLL — rolling squeezes the oxygen out from between you and your clothes." Practice together. "Which side of the fire triangle are we removing when we roll? Oxygen!"

   - **"Feel a door before opening it"**: "If a door is hot, fire is right on the other side. Opening it suddenly gives the fire a rush of fresh oxygen. A closed door slows fire's spread — sometimes for 20 minutes or more. It's buying time to escape another way."

   - **"Why smoke detectors matter"**: "Most people who die in fires aren't burned — they're overcome by smoke and a gas called carbon monoxide before they can escape. A smoke detector wakes you up before the smoke gets dangerous. It's on the ceiling because that's where smoke goes first — thermal convection."

3. **Games and Role-Play** (7-10 min):
   - **Fire Triangle Analysis**: Show picture cards of fire scenarios. For each: "Which side of the fire triangle is the hazard here? Which side could you remove?" (Matches near paper = heat + fuel nearby; candle near curtain = fuel too close to heat source; stove left on = heat without supervision.)

   - **Safe or Not Safe + Why**: Practice explaining the reason, not just the verdict. "Cooking handle turned in toward the stove — safe or not safe, and why?" (Safe — turned-in handles can't be grabbed or knocked off, preventing fuel from spilling onto heat.)

   - **Stop, Drop, and Roll Practice**: Count it together — "Stop! Drop! Roll, 2, 3, 4, 5. Roll, 2, 3, 4, 5."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   "What three things does fire need? What does crawling low do? What does rolling remove?" Let children draw the fire triangle and label the three sides. Post it somewhere visible.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on two science concepts and two physical skills. Science: "Fire needs three things — fuel, oxygen, heat" (draw the triangle together). "Smoke goes up" (blow on something light and watch it rise — same idea). Physical skills: crawling low, and stop/drop/roll. Practice both physically. Keep explanations to one or two sentences but don't skip the real concepts — "Smoke goes to the ceiling first because hot air floats up, so we crawl down here where the air is cleaner" is entirely graspable. Duration: 15-20 minutes.

**3-4+ years**:
All three concepts fully: fire triangle, thermal convection, carbon monoxide (described as "the invisible smoke that you can't see or smell — that's the most dangerous kind"). Let children explain back to you why each safety rule works — this consolidates understanding. Challenge: "If you were a firefighter and needed to put out a fire, which side of the triangle would you attack first?" Discuss how different fire extinguisher types work (water, CO2, foam). Duration: 25-30 minutes.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Community Helpers Version**: Expand beyond firefighters to include police officers and paramedics. Create simple role-play scenarios where children interact with different helpers and learn what each person does to keep us safe.

**Variation 2 - House Safety Hunt**: Walk through your home or classroom together and identify fire safety items: smoke detector (listen to the sound), fire extinguisher, exit routes, safe meeting spot. Create a simple map showing these important locations.

**Variation 3 - Safety Movements and Chants**: Create simple hand motions and a repetitive chant to remember safety rules: "If you see a fire, tell someone today / Find the nearest exit, don't delay / Get outside to safety, hurry away / We're smart and safe every day!"

**Repeat play**: Use different scenarios each time (kitchen safety, bedroom safety, camping safety). Let children lead and create their own scenarios. Revisit escape practice monthly to keep skills fresh.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes frightened or anxious about fire after learning about it

**Solution**: Young children have vivid imaginations and may worry after fire safety discussions. Use calm, matter-of-fact language. Emphasize helpers (firefighters, adults) and safe actions rather than dangers. Avoid detailed descriptions of fire or injuries. Say "We're smart and know what to do" rather than "Fire is scary." Focus the activity on what keeps us safe. If anxiety persists, dial back the activity and return to it later with a lighter, more playful approach.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't seem interested or keeps changing the subject

**Solution**: Fire safety may not feel immediately relevant to young children, or they may learn better through dramatic play than direct instruction. Turn it into pure role-play without the "lesson" feel. Use toys and characters to act out scenarios. Return to the activity in smaller doses over multiple days rather than one long session.

**Challenge**: Child asks scary questions about real fires or what happens to people

**Solution**: Answer simply and honestly: "Fire can hurt people, which is why we learn how to stay safe. Adults and firefighters know how to help. You'll always have a grown-up keeping you safe." Reassure them that their home has smoke detectors, adults are watching, and everyone knows what to do. Offer comfort and move toward positive problem-solving.

**Challenge**: Child wants to practice escape routes repeatedly or shows excessive worry

**Solution**: Some repetition is normal, but practice 2-3 times, then transition to other activities. If your child continues to show unusual worry about fire (checking doors repeatedly, asking about fire constantly), this may indicate anxiety beyond the activity. Mention it to parents/caregivers. Sometimes one experience (seeing smoke, hearing alarms) can increase concern. Reassurance and normal play help, and persistent worry warrants a conversation with parents.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Quick Daily Reinforcement**: Briefly point out safe and unsafe fire situations during daily life ("The oven is on - that's hot, so we stay back!") to reinforce learning naturally.

2. **Extend Learning at Home**: Ask parents to practice your escape plan at home and talk about their own safe meeting spot with their family.

3. **Connect to Community**: Arrange a virtual tour of a local fire station (many offer videos online), or invite a firefighter to visit if possible to reinforce that helpers are real people in the community.
