# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Fire Safety and Prevention Games

## Activity Summary

Children learn essential fire safety awareness through interactive games, storytelling, and role-playing activities that help them recognize fire hazards, understand safety rules, and practice calm, protective behaviors. This lesson combines dramatic play with life-saving knowledge, building confidence and awareness in an age-appropriate, non-frightening way that protects children in real-world situations.

## Vocabulary

**Prevention**: The action of stopping something harmful or dangerous from happening before it occurs. When we learn about fire safety, we are preventing accidents from hurting us. Example: Keeping matches and lighters away from children is a fire prevention practice.

**Hazard**: Something in our environment that could cause harm or danger. A hot stove is a fire hazard because it can burn us. Example: Leaving candles lit unattended is a hazard in the home.

**Alert**: A warning signal or message that tells us to be ready or careful about something. We use a bell or whistle alert to practice what to do if there's ever a fire. Example: When we hear the fire alarm alert, we know to get to safety immediately.

**Escape**: To move away safely from danger to a place where we are protected. If there's a fire, we escape the building by going outside to our safe meeting spot. Example: The quickest escape route from the bedroom is through the door and down the stairs.

**Cost**: Free to under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all materials and arrange in accessible locations
2. Review age-appropriate fire safety concepts, emphasizing prevention and helpful adults rather than fear
3. Prepare simple scenario cards or picture prompts (optional but helpful)
4. Ensure space is clear and safe for movement activities
5. Safety check: confirm no actual fire hazards in the activity area

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Start with a story hook: "Today we're going to play special games about fire safety - learning how to stay smart and safe at home and in our community." Show a picture of a firefighter or fire truck. Demonstrate your alert signal (bell or whistle) and explain: "This sound means 'Get to a safe place!' - let's try it together." Explain that fire keeps us warm and cooks food, but we need to be careful around it.

2. **Exploration - Story and Picture Phase** (5-7 min):
   Show picture cards of different fire scenarios: someone cooking, candles, a fireplace, someone playing with matches. Ask simple questions: "What do you see here? Is this safe or not safe? What should we do?" Let children point out items that are "hot" or "dangerous." Tell a simple story using a stuffed animal or doll as the main character learning about fire safety. Introduce key concepts: don't touch the stove, keep away from candles, tell an adult if you see fire.

3. **Discovery - Games and Role-Play** (8-12 min):
   Lead 2-3 specific fire safety games:

   - **Game 1: "Who Helps When Fire Happens?"** Show pictures of firefighters and family adults. Let children identify who helps us. Role-play: child pretends to call 911 (mime phone) and describe the problem simply. Adult responds with calm directions.

   - **Game 2: "Safe or Not Safe? Sorting Game"** Describe scenarios (examples: "Mommy cooking with you watching" vs "Playing with matches"). Children respond with thumbs up (safe), thumbs down (not safe), or move to a safe/not-safe area. Discuss why each scenario is safe or not safe.

   - **Game 3: "Fire Exit Practice"** Set up a simple "home" area using furniture or blocks. Identify windows and doors as exits. When you sound the alert signal, children practice walking (not running) to a safe place. Explain: "When we hear the alarm, we go outside to meet grown-ups at our special safe spot." Let children practice 2-3 times with positive reinforcement.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Invite children to create their own fire safety drawing, teach you a safety game they learned, or ask any final questions. Celebrate what they learned: "You're learning how to be smart and safe!" Display any creations in a visible place.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on very simple, concrete concepts and guided role-play. Use only 1-2 games (not all three). Keep stories very short - just 2-3 sentences. Use concrete props and movement rather than abstract discussion. Emphasize the safe behaviors: "Fire is hot. We don't touch fire. Adults keep us safe." Make each game shorter (3-4 minutes) with lots of physical movement. Duration: 15-20 minutes total. Provide high adult support with lots of modeling and physical help.

**3-4+ years**:
Include 3-4 different games and scenarios. Ask more "why" questions to deepen understanding ("Why do we need to tell an adult?" "What does a firefighter do?"). Add more complex escape scenarios with multiple exits. Role-play calling 911 with more realistic dialogue. Discuss different locations (kitchen, bedroom, outside) and safety in each space. Introduce "stop, drop, and roll" if appropriate for your region. Duration: 25-30 minutes. Encourage independent thinking and creative expression.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Community Helpers Version**: Expand beyond firefighters to include police officers and paramedics. Create simple role-play scenarios where children interact with different helpers and learn what each person does to keep us safe.

**Variation 2 - House Safety Hunt**: Walk through your home or classroom together and identify fire safety items: smoke detector (listen to the sound), fire extinguisher, exit routes, safe meeting spot. Create a simple map showing these important locations.

**Variation 3 - Safety Movements and Chants**: Create simple hand motions and a repetitive chant to remember safety rules: "If you see a fire, tell someone today / Find the nearest exit, don't delay / Get outside to safety, hurry away / We're smart and safe every day!"

**Repeat play**: Use different scenarios each time (kitchen safety, bedroom safety, camping safety). Let children lead and create their own scenarios. Revisit escape practice monthly to keep skills fresh.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes frightened or anxious about fire after learning about it

**Solution**: Young children have vivid imaginations and may worry after fire safety discussions. Use calm, matter-of-fact language. Emphasize helpers (firefighters, adults) and safe actions rather than dangers. Avoid detailed descriptions of fire or injuries. Say "We're smart and know what to do" rather than "Fire is scary." Focus the activity on what keeps us safe. If anxiety persists, dial back the activity and return to it later with a lighter, more playful approach.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't seem interested or keeps changing the subject

**Solution**: Fire safety may not feel immediately relevant to young children, or they may learn better through dramatic play than direct instruction. Turn it into pure role-play without the "lesson" feel. Use toys and characters to act out scenarios. Return to the activity in smaller doses over multiple days rather than one long session.

**Challenge**: Child asks scary questions about real fires or what happens to people

**Solution**: Answer simply and honestly: "Fire can hurt people, which is why we learn how to stay safe. Adults and firefighters know how to help. You'll always have a grown-up keeping you safe." Reassure them that their home has smoke detectors, adults are watching, and everyone knows what to do. Offer comfort and move toward positive problem-solving.

**Challenge**: Child wants to practice escape routes repeatedly or shows excessive worry

**Solution**: Some repetition is normal, but practice 2-3 times, then transition to other activities. If your child continues to show unusual worry about fire (checking doors repeatedly, asking about fire constantly), this may indicate anxiety beyond the activity. Mention it to parents/caregivers. Sometimes one experience (seeing smoke, hearing alarms) can increase concern. Reassurance and normal play help, and persistent worry warrants a conversation with parents.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Quick Daily Reinforcement**: Briefly point out safe and unsafe fire situations during daily life ("The oven is on - that's hot, so we stay back!") to reinforce learning naturally.

2. **Extend Learning at Home**: Ask parents to practice your escape plan at home and talk about their own safe meeting spot with their family.

3. **Connect to Community**: Arrange a virtual tour of a local fire station (many offer videos online), or invite a firefighter to visit if possible to reinforce that helpers are real people in the community.
