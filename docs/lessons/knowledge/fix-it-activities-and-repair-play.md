# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Fix-it Activities and Repair Play

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Fix-it activities and repair play invite young children to explore problem-solving, tool use, and the practical satisfaction of making things work. Through safe, age-appropriate repair and construction experiences, children develop fine motor skills, spatial reasoning, confidence in their ability to tackle challenges, and respect for resources and sustainability.

## Vocabulary

**Repair**: To fix something that is broken or not working properly. When a toy stops moving or a lid doesn't close, we can use tools to make it work again.

**Disassemble**: To take something apart carefully to see how it works inside. By removing screws and bolts, we discover all the hidden parts that make things function.

**Problem-solve**: To figure out how to fix something that isn't working the way it should. When we ask "What tool should we try?" or "Let's see what's inside," we're finding solutions.

**Mechanism**: The parts inside something that work together to make it function. Screws, springs, wheels, and gears are all mechanisms that help toys and objects do their jobs.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
Old MacDonald had a shop, E-I-E-I-O
Full of things we had to fix, E-I-E-I-O
With a screw screw here, and a bolt bolt there
Here a screw, there a bolt, everywhere a screw-screw
Old MacDonald had a shop, E-I-E-I-O

*Verse 2*
We can take the things apart, E-I-E-I-O
See the pieces, learn the parts, E-I-E-I-O
With a twist twist here, and a turn turn there
Here a twist, there a turn, let's discover it all
We can take the things apart, E-I-E-I-O

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Pretend to turn a screwdriver in circles (twist motion)
2. Open and close hands like tightening and loosening bolts
3. Point around the room at things that might be taken apart and fixed

## Activity

### Activity Overview

In this hands-on activity, children safely explore broken or "broken" items using child-appropriate tools like screwdrivers, hammers, and wrenches. They'll discover what's inside objects, experiment with removing and reattaching parts, and experience the satisfaction of making things work. The focus is on curiosity, experimentation, and learning—not on achieving a "perfect" repair.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on exploration and problem-solving

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Broken or safe "broken" items (old toys, remote controls, wooden containers—nothing with sharp edges or electrical hazards)
- Child-safe tools (soft-grip screwdrivers, child's hammer, adjustable wrench, pliers)
- Large bolts, screws, and nuts (easy-to-handle sizes)
- Masking tape
- String or yarn
- Newspaper or craft mat to protect surfaces

**Optional**:
- Flashlight or headlamp for "inspection"
- Small toolbox for storage and pretend play
- Small LED lights for testing fixes
- Pictures of tools and repairs as visual references
- "Fix-it Certificate" template for celebrating success

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (most items are household reuse or items you already have)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather safe, broken items—avoid anything with sharp edges, small choking hazards, or electrical cords
2. Test all tools to ensure no sharp points or broken handles
3. Sand any rough edges smooth, and secure any loose parts that might break off
4. Clear a sturdy table or work surface with plenty of space for exploration

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Show the child a broken item with enthusiasm: "This toy doesn't work quite right—would you like to help fix it?" Introduce tools one at a time, demonstrating each gently. Ask the child to notice details: "What do you see? What parts do you notice?" Set simple safety expectations: "Tools help us learn—let's be careful and kind with them."

2. **Exploration** (5-8 minutes):
   Invite the child to pick up items, turn them over, shake them, and listen. Narrate what they're discovering: "You found a screw! What else do you see inside?" Offer a flashlight: "Let's shine light in there and see what's hidden." Ask open-ended questions to deepen curiosity: "Do you see any other screws?" "What do you think that part does?"

3. **Discovery** (5-10 minutes):
   Model using tools gently: align the screwdriver tip with a screw, turn it slowly, and narrate the action. Demonstrate removing and reattaching bolts or nuts, taping broken pieces, and using a hammer gently on nails. Encourage the child to try the same actions, offering hand-over-hand help if needed. Celebrate attempts: "You're turning it—that takes strength!" When something doesn't work, normalize problem-solving: "That way didn't work—let's try this way instead."

4. **Wrap-up** (3-5 minutes):
   Review the child's work together: "Tell me about this one—what did you fix?" Acknowledge their effort and persistence. Involve the child in putting tools away: "Screwdrivers go in this pocket." Wash hands together at the sink as a natural conclusion.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Start with very simple items (old remote, wooden container with a hinged lid). Use only 2-3 tools maximum. Focus on removal and reassembly rather than "fixing." Use very large bolts and screws that don't require much force. The adult leads most actions while the child observes, touches, and tries. Keep sessions to 10-15 minutes. Provide very high adult support with hand-over-hand guidance and constant narration.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce 4-5 different types of tools. Offer slightly more complex items with multiple parts. Ask the child to identify problems before fixing: "Why do you think this doesn't work?" Encourage drawing or explaining what they fixed. Introduce cause-and-effect thinking: "When we tightened this bolt, what happened?" Allow more independence with tool use (with supervision). Extend sessions to 20-30 minutes. Challenge the child: "Can you fix this using only the screwdriver?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Themed Tool Use — Focus on one specific tool each session (Screwdriver Day, Wrench Day, Hammer Day). The child becomes an expert in that tool's use while repairing different items.

**Variation 2**: Take-Apart Stations — Set up different stations with items to disassemble (old computer keyboard, broken toy, wooden box). Focus on discovery rather than repair.

**Repeat play**: Familiar items allow deeper exploration over multiple sessions. Store "fixed" items in an accessible container so the child can return to them over days or weeks, discovering something new each time.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to use tools on items that aren't safe to disassemble (electronics, items with batteries, sharp edges).

**Solution**: Pre-screen all items and only provide clearly safe options. Keep unsafe items out of reach. Use language: "This one is too sharp for our hands, but this one is perfect for learning!"

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated when something doesn't come apart or go back together.

**Solution**: Offer hand-over-hand support, break tasks into smaller steps. Normalize struggle: "This is hard work! Let's try a different way." Intersperse easier success experiences so the child builds confidence.

**Challenge**: Child uses tools too aggressively (hitting hard, forcing bolts) or unsafely.

**Solution**: Stay close and redirect gently: "Gentle taps with the hammer—listen to the sound." Model soft tool use repeatedly. Take a break if the child becomes wild or unsafe.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Repair Journal** — Take photos of your child at work and with finished items. Create a simple photo journal of repair projects over time.

2. **Community Helpers Visit** — Invite a family member who works in maintenance, repair, or construction to show their tools and explain their work.

3. **Create a Workshop** — Dedicate a shelf or basket in your home as the child's "repair workshop." Keep gathered safe broken items there for ongoing exploration and play.
