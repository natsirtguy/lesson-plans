# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Forces and Motion

## Activity Summary

Children will explore how things move and what makes them move through hands-on experiments with pushes, pulls, and rolling objects. This lesson helps young learners understand the fundamental concept that forces (pushes and pulls) cause objects to move, stop, or change direction—building early physics understanding through direct sensory experience.

## Vocabulary

Select 3-4 vocabulary words that are sophisticated but age-appropriate and directly relate to the topic:

**Force**: A push or pull that makes something move, stop, or change direction. When you push a ball across the floor, you're using force. When you pull a toy wagon, that's also a force.

**Motion**: The movement of something from one place to another. When a toy car rolls down a ramp, it's in motion. Your legs are in motion when you run and play.

**Momentum**: The power something has because it's moving. A rolling ball has momentum that keeps it rolling forward. The bigger and faster something moves, the more momentum it has.

**Friction**: A force that slows things down or stops them from sliding. When you rub your hands together quickly, friction makes them feel warm. Friction is what makes a ball stop rolling.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"

**Tempo**: Moderate

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 4-6 lines each):

*Verse 1*
Push and pull and watch things move
Forces make the toys go zoom
Rolling, sliding, spinning round
Motion happens all around
Push it, pull it, watch it go
Fast or slow or stop just so

*Verse 2*
Friction makes the sliding slow
Momentum keeps the objects go
Pull a wagon cross the floor
Forces are what make things soar
Everything that moves around
Has a force that makes that sound

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Push motion: Extend both palms forward with a pushing gesture for "push" lines
2. Pull motion: Make a pulling gesture toward body with both hands for "pull" lines
3. Circular motion: Rotate hands in circles for "rolling, spinning, momentum" lines
4. Slow-down motion: Gradually slow hand movements to show friction stopping motion

## Intro Video Recommendation

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will investigate forces and motion through a series of simple, tactile experiments with rolling, pushing, and pulling objects. They'll observe how different forces affect movement, discover friction through hands-on play, and begin to understand cause-and-effect relationships between actions and movement.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on discovery/Sensory exploration

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Toy cars, balls, or rolling toys (3-4 different objects)
- Wooden board, cardboard, or foam ramp (or create one with stacked books)
- Smooth surface area (wood floor, tile, or laminate)
- Textured surface (carpet, rug, or towel)
- Small objects for pushing/pulling (stuffed animals, blocks, toy containers)
- String or rope for pulling activities

**Optional**:
- Different types of balls (rubber, wooden, foam)
- Cardboard tubes for rolling experiments
- Ramps at different angles
- Spoons for pushing smaller objects
- Sandbox or rice tray for friction exploration

**Cost**: Free to Under $5 (using household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Clear a large play space with both smooth and textured surfaces
2. Set up the ramp at a gentle angle (using books, blocks, or a board propped up)
3. Gather all rolling and rolling objects within reach
4. Place string/rope within easy access for pulling demonstrations
5. Safety check: Remove any small choking hazards, ensure ramp is stable

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   - Gather child in play space and say: "Today we're going to make things move! We can push things, pull things, and watch them roll."
   - Demonstrate a simple push of a toy car and a pull of a toy wagon
   - Ask: "What happens when I push this car? What happens when I pull this wagon?"
   - Use exaggerated movements to make forces visible
   - Introduce vocabulary: "We're using a FORCE—that's a push or a pull!"

2. **Exploration** (8-10 minutes):
   - **Pushing exploration**: Give child a toy car or ball. Encourage different kinds of pushes: gentle pushes, big pushes, slow pushes. Ask: "What happens when you push gently? What happens with a big push?"
   - **Ramp rolling**: Place toy car at top of ramp. Release and let it roll. Ask child to predict: "What will happen?" Then release. Repeat with different objects.
   - **Pulling exploration**: Tie string to a toy wagon, container, or stuffed animal. Let child pull it across smooth surface, then across carpet. Ask: "Does it move easier on the floor or the rug?"
   - **Friction discovery**: Roll a ball on smooth surface, then on carpet. Have child feel the difference. Show how friction slows things down.
   - **Momentum play**: Roll a ball and have child watch it slow down and stop. Ask: "Why did it stop?"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   - Point out observations: "See how the big push made the car go faster? The small push was slower."
   - Ask guiding questions: "What happens when the ramp is steeper? What makes things stop rolling? Why is it harder to pull on the carpet?"
   - Celebrate observations: "You discovered that friction slows things down!"
   - Make connections: "When you run and then stop, friction from the ground helps you stop. When a toy slides on carpet, friction makes it slow down faster than on the floor."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   - Gather objects together
   - Ask child to demonstrate one more push, pull, or roll
   - Sing the learning song together with actions
   - Transition: "Great job discovering forces! Now [next activity]."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus on simple cause-and-effect: push → motion
- Use only 2-3 objects (avoid overwhelming choices)
- Keep exploration short and concrete
- Use large, easy-to-manipulate toys (large toy cars, squishy balls)
- Avoid complex ramps; use very gentle slopes
- Emphasize sensory experience over understanding
- Repeat the same activity multiple times for familiarity
- Use simple one-word descriptions: "Push! Roll! Pull!"

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce comparative language: "faster/slower," "harder/easier"
- Use the vocabulary words (force, motion, friction, momentum)
- Encourage predictions before each action: "What do you think will happen?"
- Create more complex experiments: ramps at different angles, different surfaces
- Ask "why" questions to encourage thinking: "Why did that roll faster?"
- Record observations (draw pictures of fast vs. slow, smooth vs. bumpy)
- Extend to patterns: "What always happens when we push? Can we make something go super fast?"
- Compare different objects: "Does the heavy ball roll differently than the light ball?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Ramp Races**: Create multiple ramps and race different objects down them. Which goes faster? Why? Encourage predictions and testing.

**Variation 2 - Obstacle Course**: Set up a simple path with stops and turns. Use pushing and pulling to navigate toys through the course. Discover how force and direction work together.

**Variation 3 - Friction Investigation**: Compare rolling on different surfaces (carpet, tile, towel, outside on concrete, on grass). Create a "friction chart" by drawing which surfaces are "fast" or "slow."

**Repeat play**: Change the objects being rolled, vary the ramp angle, add obstacles, use different surfaces. Each session feels like a new discovery because the variables can change constantly.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child loses interest or becomes frustrated with repeated rolling activities.
**Solution**: Vary the objects frequently. Switch between pushing, pulling, and rolling every 2-3 minutes. Let the child choose what to explore next. Sometimes a 5-minute break and return later works better than forcing engagement. Make it playful—race the toys, make sound effects, celebrate discoveries enthusiastically.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand cause-and-effect or why things move/stop.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal for 2-3 year-olds. Use simple, repetitive language: "You pushed it! Look, it moved!" Point out the action and the result clearly. Repeat the same action many times so patterns become obvious. Use very dramatic movements and sounds to emphasize the connection. As children mature, they'll naturally begin to understand.

**Challenge**: The activity becomes too wild or chaotic (child is running around with balls/toys instead of focused exploration).
**Solution**: Establish clear boundaries before starting: "We're going to sit here and roll the ball down the ramp. Let's see what happens." Start with a contained space. If energy is too high, do physical activity first, then return to exploration when calm. Keep sessions short—15 minutes is enough.

**Challenge**: Sibling or second child wants to participate, causing competition or interruptions.
**Solution**: Provide duplicate objects so both can explore simultaneously. Take turns being the "predictor" (who guesses what will happen) and the "roller" (who makes it happen). Create separate but parallel activities: one child tests ramp rolling, another tests friction on different surfaces.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily observation**: Throughout the day, point out forces in action: "Mommy is pushing the stroller—that's a force! You're pulling your jacket on—that's a force too!" Build awareness that forces are everywhere.

2. **Playground extension**: Visit a playground and explore forces in natural settings. Watch slides (gravity + friction), swings (pushing motion), climbing (pulling yourself up). Talk about forces: "This swing has momentum—it keeps going even after we stop pushing!"

3. **Story connection**: Read books about movement and motion. Examples: "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" (crawling motion), "The Little Engine That Could" (pushing/force), "Rosie's Walk" (movement through space). Connect to vocabulary.

4. **Sensory exploration**: Explore friction through texture play. Feel smooth objects (low friction) vs. bumpy/rough objects (high friction). Roll objects through sand, water, or rice to observe how different mediums resist motion.
