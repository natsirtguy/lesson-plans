# ARTS & CULTURE ACTIVITY: Group Meetings and Discussions

## Activity Summary

In this activity, children participate in structured group meetings or discussion circles where they gather to talk, listen, share ideas, make decisions, or solve problems together. This might include morning meetings, story-sharing circles, problem-solving discussions, or simple councils where everyone has a voice. Children practice listening skills, turn-taking, expressing ideas respectfully, making group decisions, and contributing to group thinking. This activity develops communication skills, collaborative thinking, social-emotional competence, understanding of democratic processes, and sense of belonging to a group. Children learn that their voices matter and that groups can make decisions together.

**Activity Type**: Social activity / Communication / Group process

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (depends on group size and discussion focus)

**Mess Level**: Low (no materials mess; emotional experience may be variable)

**Best Environment**: Group gathering space, ideally a circle on floor or around table where all can see each other

**Cost estimate**: Free (most items likely in home)

**Preparation time**: 5-10 minutes (arranging seating, preparing any talking object or recording supplies)

### Step-by-Step Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Choose the purpose of the meeting: morning check-in, sharing circle, problem-solving, decision-making, story circle, or general discussion
2. Decide on a manageable group size (works best with 2-4 young children per adult, up to 6 children total)
3. Gather participants and explain the purpose simply
4. Arrange seating in a circle so everyone can see and hear each other
5. Prepare any visual aids or recording materials
6. Establish any group signals or procedures (talking object, raised hand, turn-taking system)

**Environment setup**:
- Arrange circle seating on floor or around table, ideally so eye contact is possible
- Remove visual distractions (toys, screens, clutter) from the meeting area
- Position yourself in the circle as a participant, not standing above
- Keep the space comfortable (not too hot, not too crowded)
- If using a talking object, have it readily accessible in the center of the circle
- Ensure comfortable seating - some children may sit, some may stand
- Create a calm, attentive atmosphere

**Cleaning supplies ready**:
- Paper towels or cloth
- Hand sanitizer if needed
- No major cleanup needed; mostly a process-based activity

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Call the group together: "Everyone, let's come together for our meeting. We're going to sit in a circle so we can see each other"
- Explain the purpose: "Today we're gathering to [share our ideas/talk about something/make a decision/help solve a problem]"
- Set the tone: "In our meeting, we listen to each other, we're kind, and everyone gets a turn to talk if they want to"
- Show any tools (talking object, timer, chart): "This [object] helps us take turns. When you have the object, it's your turn to speak"
- Begin with a grounding activity (singing, deep breaths, moment of silence): "Let's start by taking a deep breath together"

**Setting expectations**:
- "Everyone's idea matters - even if it's different from someone else's idea"
- "We listen when others talk - we don't interrupt"
- "It's okay if you don't want to share - you can just listen"
- "We use kind words and kind voices"

### Main Activity (10-18 minutes)

**Phase 1: Opening/Check-in** (3-5 minutes)
Begin with something to help children focus and share
- Simple check-in: "How are you feeling today?" or "What's one thing you did this morning?"
- Weather/mood circle: "Show me with your body how you're feeling" or use emotion cards
- Gratitude or appreciation: "One thing I'm happy about..." or "One thing I like about our group is..."
- Story or topic introduction: Adult briefly introduces the topic for discussion
- Singing or recitation together: Opening song, poem, or shared words
- This phase helps transition to focused group listening and establishes a sharing tone

**Phase 2: Main Discussion/Activity** (5-10 minutes)
Conduct the core meeting activity
For sharing circle/story sharing:
- Go around circle (or allow voluntary sharing); each child shares a thought, experience, or story
- Adult also participates: "I have something to share too"
- Others listen; consider a simple rule: "No comments while someone is sharing - we listen fully"
- After sharing, you might ask: "Does anyone have a question for [child's name]?" or just listen appreciatively

For problem-solving discussion:
- Present the problem or challenge: "We have a problem. Two friends want the same toy. What can we do?"
- Invite suggestions: "What ideas do you have? Let's think together"
- Discuss ideas: "Tell us more about that idea. What would happen if we tried that?"
- Consider each idea without judgment: "That's an interesting idea"
- Work toward group solution: "Which idea do you think would work best?"

For decision-making meeting:
- Present choices: "We need to decide whether to read a book or paint today"
- Discuss options: "What do you like about each choice?"
- Vote or discuss consensus: "Everyone who wants to [option 1], show me thumbs up"
- Decide together: "We chose [option]. Let's do that together"

For general sharing/discussion:
- Use open-ended prompts: "What did you notice today?" or "What are you wondering about?"
- Allow natural conversation to develop
- Help keep focus and ensure turn-taking
- Validate contributions: "That's an interesting thought" or "Thank you for sharing"

**Phase 3: Closing** (2-3 minutes)
Close the meeting intentionally
- Review or summarize what was discussed: "We talked about [topic]. We decided to [decision]"
- Express appreciation: "Thank you all for sharing and listening today"
- Closing gesture: song, hand squeeze around circle, deep breath together
- Transition: "Now we're going to [next activity]"

**Adult role**:
- Lead the meeting with clear structure and calm presence
- Model active listening - look at speaker, show engagement, validate contributions
- Manage turn-taking fairly; use talking object or hand-raising system
- Ask clarifying or deepening questions: "Tell us more," "How did that make you feel?"
- Gently redirect if discussion goes off-topic: "That's interesting. Let's save that thought. Right now we're talking about..."
- Ensure all children who want to participate have opportunities
- Don't force quieter children to share, but invite participation
- Model the behavior you want: listen fully, speak respectfully, consider others' ideas
- Keep the discussion positive and inclusive

### Wrap-Up (1-2 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- "Our meeting is finished. We listened to each other and shared together"
- Acknowledge the group effort: "I appreciated how everyone listened"
- Transition to next activity or end session
- Children may naturally move to next activity or maintain calm as transition continues

**Extending the discussion**:
- Refer back to the discussion throughout the day: "Remember in our meeting when [child] shared about...?"
- Follow up on decisions made: "We decided to do [activity] because the group voted for it"
- Connect learning: If problem-solving was discussed, observe and comment when children work toward solutions
- Record the meeting: simple drawings, photos, or notes to remember what was discussed

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Approach**:
- Very short meetings (10-15 minutes) with simple focus
- Use concrete topics and simple language
- Focus on very brief sharing or one-word check-ins ("Happy?" "Sad?")
- Adult does most of the talking and facilitating; children participate minimally
- Use visual aids, songs, or movement to maintain interest
- Expect short attention span; be flexible with time
- May be more successful as a one-on-one or very small group activity (2-3 children)
- Keep expectations low for "discussion" - just being together and listening is success
- Use physical comfort: sitting close, hand-holding, warm tone

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

**Adult support**: Very high - adult directs meeting, children participate at their level with lots of support and prompting

### 3-4+ years

**Extensions**:
- Longer, more elaborate meetings (20-25 minutes) with complex topics
- More sophisticated sharing and discussion
- Children remember and refer to previous discussions
- Use of more formal meeting structures (agenda, decisions, voting)
- Teach problem-solving process: problem identification, brainstorming solutions, evaluation, decision
- Introduce note-taking or recording of ideas and decisions
- Use visual supports (charts, cards, pictures) to structure discussion
- Teach turn-taking systems and allow children to manage the talking object
- More genuine discussion where children respond to each other's ideas
- Connect meetings to real situations and decisions affecting the group

**Duration**: 20-25 minutes; sustained attention and genuine participation

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Regular Morning Meetings** - Establish a daily morning meeting routine that becomes part of the group's culture

**Variation 2: Specialized Meetings** - Hold different types of meetings for different purposes (problem-solving meetings, celebration meetings, planning meetings)

**Variation 3: Community Meetings** - Invite broader community to participate (family members, neighbors) in larger group discussions and decision-making

**Variation 4: Child-Led Meetings** - As children grow comfortable, invite them to lead parts of the meeting or facilitate discussion

**Thematic variations**:
- Seasonal check-ins (what do we notice about the season?)
- Gratitude meetings (appreciation and thankfulness focused)
- Creative solution meetings (focusing on solving real group challenges)
- Celebration meetings (honoring group achievements and connections)
- Nature discussion circles (talking about observations from outdoor time)

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**: Group meetings, councils, and circles are foundational to human community and decision-making across cultures. From talking circles in Indigenous traditions, to town halls in democratic communities, to family conferences, to school councils - humans have always gathered to discuss, decide, and solve problems together. The ability to listen, speak truthfully, consider others' perspectives, and make decisions as a group is essential to healthy communities. By engaging in discussion circles and group meetings, children learn that their voice matters, that different perspectives are valuable, that people can work together to solve problems, and that communities function through communication and mutual respect. This is an early introduction to democratic participation and community responsibility.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Learn about talking circles in Indigenous cultures and their principles of respectful listening
- Explore different cultures' approaches to family decision-making and discussion
- Discuss how communities in different cultures gather to solve problems or make decisions
- Read about or experience different cultural meeting practices
- Honor different communication styles and cultural norms around discussion
- Include family traditions around gathering and sharing

**Books/Media**:
- "The Great Big Book of Families" by Mary Ann Hoberman (how different families talk together)
- "The Important Book" by Margaret Wise Brown (discussion starter)
- Picture books about cooperation and group decision-making

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Some children dominate discussion while others don't participate
**Why**: Children have different temperaments; some are naturally more verbal; some need more time to warm up
**Solution**: Use a talking object so only one person can speak at a time. Invite quieter children directly: "We'd like to hear from you. Do you have something to share?" Don't force, but create space. Some children participate by listening, which is valid

**Challenge**: Children go off-topic or discussion becomes chaotic
**Why**: Young children have difficulty maintaining focus on abstract topics; their minds naturally wander and connect to other ideas
**Solution**: Gently refocus: "That's interesting! Let's save that thought for later. Right now we're talking about..." Keep topics concrete and relevant to their experience. Keep meetings shorter. Use visual aids to maintain focus

**Challenge**: Emotions emerge - child cries or becomes upset during discussion
**Why**: Discussions can touch on feelings or experiences that trigger emotion - which is healthy but can be unexpected
**Solution**: Pause and offer comfort: sit close, offer a tissue, acknowledge: "It sounds like this is important to you" Don't rush the emotion away. A brief break or transition might be needed. This is a normal part of group discussions and processing

**Challenge**: Group becomes overstimulated or anxious; the meeting feels tense rather than supportive
**Why**: Groups can have collective energy that amplifies emotion; too much intensity can dysregulate children
**Solution**: Slow down. Use calming elements: soft voice, deep breaths, shorter sharing, more singing or movement. Take a break. Return to meeting later. Not every meeting needs to be serious - some should be light and fun

**Challenge**: Children see discussion time as a chance to complain or blame others
**Why**: Young children are still developing emotional regulation and perspective-taking; blame feels easier than empathy
**Solution**: Redirect gently toward problem-solving: "Instead of telling me who did something wrong, let's think about how to fix it" Model positive communication: "I felt upset when..." rather than "You did..." Celebrate and acknowledge when children express feelings positively

### Tips for Success
- Start with very simple, concrete topics before moving to abstract discussions
- Make the meeting environment comfortable and inviting - soft seating, calm lighting, peaceful space
- Use consistent rituals (opening song, talking object, closing gesture) so children know what to expect
- Model the listening and speaking behavior you want to see
- Validate all contributions, even ideas you wouldn't choose or agree with
- Keep the emotional tone positive and supportive rather than critical
- Use the talking object or visible system to manage turn-taking fairly
- Celebrate group decisions even if not everyone would have chosen them
- Keep meetings short enough that children stay engaged and positive
- Connect meeting discussions to real life: "Remember in our meeting we decided...?"

### What to Do With the Creation
- The discussion itself and the shared experience are the main "creation"
- Consider recording key ideas, decisions, or memorable statements on chart paper to display
- Take photos of the group gathered to celebrate the community meeting
- Create a simple record: "We met today and talked about..." with children's drawings or words
- Save any decisions made for implementation and reference: "We voted to...and here's what happened"
- Create a meeting journal documenting what's discussed over time
- Celebrate group decisions and follow through on them so children see their contributions matter
- Return to previous discussion topics: "Remember when we talked about...? What do you think now?"
- Build on discussions in future meetings, showing continuity and that ideas matter
