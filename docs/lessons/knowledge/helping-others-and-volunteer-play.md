# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Helping Others and Volunteer Play

## Activity Summary

In this activity, children engage in pretend play scenarios where they help others, serve their community, and practice caring behaviors through role-playing as community helpers. Through games like pretend store, clinic play, or helping with real tasks, children develop empathy, social awareness, and understanding of how people work together. This activity builds prosocial skills, emotional intelligence, and a foundation for understanding community roles and interdependence.

## Vocabulary

**Volunteer**: Someone who chooses to help others without being asked to do so. When you volunteer, you offer your time and energy to help make something better for someone else—like helping a friend build a block tower.

**Empathy**: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. When you see someone sad and you feel sad too, and want to help them feel better, that's empathy.

**Community**: A group of people who live or work together and help and support one another. Your family is a small community, and your neighborhood is a larger community.

**Reciprocal**: Taking turns helping each other back and forth. When you help someone and they help you, that's reciprocal helping—you both care for each other.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore helping through dramatic play and role-playing as community helpers. They practice empathy, kindness, and cooperation by taking on helper roles (doctor, baker, teacher, mail carrier) and serving others in pretend scenarios. Through this imaginative play, children develop understanding of different jobs, practice prosocial skills, and experience the satisfaction of caring for others.

**Activity Type**: Dramatic play/Social role-playing/Cultural practice

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Pretend play props (play money, shopping bags, toy food items)
- Stuffed animals or dolls (3-5 items)
- Simple dress-up clothes (oversized shirts, hats, aprons)
- Picture cards showing community helpers (doctor, baker, teacher, mail carrier)
- Small baskets or containers for "collecting" or "delivering"

**Optional**:
- Play stethoscope and thermometer for doctor play
- Empty boxes to create a "store counter"
- Name badges or signs identifying roles
- Real (or toy) cleaning supplies for helping scenarios
- Books about community helpers

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (most items repurposed from home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather dress-up items and arrange in accessible pile or basket
2. Set up pretend play space with a simple "station" (table, shelf, or marked area)
3. Arrange props at child height for easy access and safety

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Show a picture of a community helper and ask: "What does this person do? How do they help others?" Model a simple helping action: "Watch me pretend to be a baker. I'm making bread to share with friends!" Describe what children will do: "Today, we're going to pretend to help people in our community. You can be a helper too!"

2. **Exploration** (5-8 min):
   Show available dress-up items and props one at a time. Ask: "Who could wear this hat? What would they do?" Let children choose a prop or costume piece. Introduce one helper scenario: "Let's play store! I'm the baker, and you're my customer." Model the scenario first: "I'm wrapping this pretend bread. Here you go! Thank you for coming!"

3. **Discovery** (8-12 min):
   Ask guiding questions: "How does the customer feel? What should we say?" Rotate roles so children experience both helper and person being helped. Introduce new scenarios gently: clinic play, delivering items, cleaning up together. Demonstrate simple helping tasks: "I'm helping sweep the floor!" Support children playing together: "You're both helpers! Great teamwork!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Signal ending: "In a few minutes, we'll finish our helper play." Transition to cleanup by making it part of helping: "Real helpers clean up too!" Reflection question: "Who did you help today in our pretend play? How did it feel?" Share observation: "I noticed how gently you helped your friend. That was so kind!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep scenarios very simple (one helper role at a time). Use familiar, concrete items (real food props, actual dolls). Model extensively with minimal expectation of independent role-play. Focus on following simple actions: handing items, gentle touching. Use lots of verbal narration: "You're giving water to the baby. The baby is happy!" Shorter engagement (15-20 minutes). Provide high adult support with frequent modeling and narration of actions.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce multiple scenarios and encourage children to choose their own helper role. Ask children to create their own helping scenarios: "What kind of helper would you like to be?" Encourage longer narrative play: "Tell me about who you're helping." Support peer collaboration where children organize play together. Introduce problem-solving: "The toy needs help. What should we do?" Create scenarios with more props and multi-step helping tasks. Can sustain 25-30 minutes or longer.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Community Helper Focus**
Pick one community helper each session (baker, doctor, teacher, mail carrier, librarian, firefighter). Provide more specific props related to that role and read a book about that helper.

**Variation 2: Real Helping Tasks**
Combine pretend play with actual helping: children pretend to help, then do real helping tasks (watering plants, wiping tables, sorting items, helping fold cloths).

**Variation 3: Helping Chain**
Create scenarios where one child helps another, who then helps a third child or animal: "The doctor helps the patient. The patient helps the baby. The baby helps the pet."

**Repeat play**: Children often need repetition to deepen understanding and maintain interest. Each session can focus on a different helper role or introduce props related to a new community helper.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is resistant to role-playing or doesn't understand what to pretend
**Solution**: Start with you doing all the pretending while the child watches and participates minimally. Use real props and real scenarios first (actual helping tasks) before moving to fully pretend. Narrate extensively: "I'm pretending this is a store. You can pretend to be a customer. Let's try!"

**Challenge**: Child focuses on props rather than the helping scenario
**Solution**: Reduce the number of props available. Focus on simple actions you can both do together. Provide real helping opportunities alongside pretend ones. Celebrate any caring actions, even simple ones.

**Challenge**: Conflict arises during pretend play (who gets to be the helper, taking turns)
**Solution**: Set clear expectations before play: "Everyone gets a turn to be the helper." Use a simple timer or song to signal turns. Practice together: "First you help me, then I help you." Model cooperative helping: "Let's both be helpers together!"

**Challenge**: Child engages in aggressive play (hitting a doll while "helping")
**Solution**: Calmly redirect: "Helpers use gentle hands. Like this." Show gentle touching. Practice together: "Gentle, gentle, gentle." Provide immediate feedback when child is gentle: "That's perfect gentle helping!"

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Real Helping Practice**: Combine pretend play with actual helping tasks at home—watering plants, wiping tables, helping with laundry, or caring for a pet.

2. **Community Helper Exploration**: Help children notice helpers in their actual world (crossing guard, garbage collector, grocery store cashier). Point out and appreciate their work.

3. **Helping at Home**: Encourage family caregivers to notice and comment on helping behaviors they see at home. Children thrive when helping is recognized and celebrated.
