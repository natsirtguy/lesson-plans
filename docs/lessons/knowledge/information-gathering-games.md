# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Information Gathering Games

## Activity Summary

Children explore the joy of seeking, discovering, and solving through interactive games that build observation and investigative skills. This lesson introduces the concept of gathering information through careful looking, listening, and thinking—developing critical thinking in an engaging, playful way.

## Vocabulary

**Observe**: To watch carefully and notice details about something. When you observe, you use your eyes (and sometimes ears and other senses) to see and understand what's happening around you. Example: "I observed a ladybug on the leaf and noticed it had red wings with black spots."

**Investigate**: To search for information or look carefully to understand how something works or where something is hidden. Investigators are curious and ask lots of questions. Example: "We investigated the garden and found three different kinds of bugs hiding under leaves."

**Clue**: A piece of information or hint that helps you figure something out or find what you're looking for. Clues help you solve mysteries. Example: "The clue was the muddy paw prints leading to where the toy was hidden."

**Pattern**: A way that things repeat or follow a rule—like colors, shapes, or sounds that happen in order. Recognizing patterns helps you predict what comes next. Example: "The pattern on your shirt is red stripe, blue stripe, red stripe, blue stripe."

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
Look around and find the things,
Hidden in your room right here.
Search and observe with your eyes,
Every clue is waiting there.
Look around and find so much,
Searching for the truth and light.

*Verse 2*
Pay attention to each clue,
Patterns help you understand.
Find the objects one by one,
Let's explore and search around.
There are always things to find,
In your home and everywhere.

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Cup hands around eyes like binoculars and slowly sweep side to side while singing
2. Point fingers at different spots in the room as if spotting clues
3. Turn around slowly with arms stretched out to show searching everywhere

## Intro Video Recommendation

**Recommended video**: Search for "I Spy with My Little Eye song for toddlers" or "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood Investigation episode"

**What to look for**:
- 3-5 minutes long
- Simple, clear narration about finding and observing
- Bright, colorful scenes with things to spot
- Calm, encouraging tone
- No scary or stressful moments

**Alternative searches**:
- "Blue's Clues thinking about clues"
- "Toddler observation games outdoor"
- "I Spy educational video for preschoolers"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will participate in guided information-gathering games where they search for hidden objects, follow clues, and discover patterns. This hands-on exploration builds observational skills while encouraging curiosity and independent thinking.

**Activity Type**: Discovery play and investigative exploration

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- 5-8 small household items to hide (toy, spoon, block, book, stuffed animal, etc.)
- Basket or bag to collect found items
- A space where items can be hidden (bedroom, playroom, or living room)

**Optional**:
- Simple picture cards showing what items to find
- Magnifying glass (toy or real)
- Notebook or clipboard for "detective notes"
- Printed clue cards with hints (words or simple pictures)
- Stickers to mark found items

**Cost**: Free (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose 5-8 simple items from around your home
2. Hide items in obvious but not immediately visible places (under a blanket, behind a cushion, on a shelf, inside an open container)
3. Prepare simple clue cards if using them (can draw pictures or write one-word hints)
4. Ensure the space is safe with no hazards

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Sit down together and introduce the investigation: "Today we're going to be detectives! We're going to search for hidden treasures and gather information."
   - Show one item and then hide it together. Ask: "Where should we look? What clues help us find it?"
   - Demonstrate searching by looking carefully in one spot, observing ("I see..."), and checking if the item is there

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   - Give the first clue or challenge: "Let's find the blue toy!" or "Let's find something soft."
   - Encourage the child to search the room systematically (start at one end, move across)
   - Point out observations together: "Do you see something round?" or "Listen—what can you hear?"
   - When an item is found, celebrate and place it in the collection basket
   - Continue with 3-5 more items, varying the difficulty and types of clues

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   - Ask investigative questions: "What did we find? What was hiding? How did you find it?"
   - Point out patterns: "All the toys we found were soft. Did you notice?"
   - Identify clues that helped: "You found the red ball because you were looking for something red!"
   - Count or sort the found items by color, size, or type

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   - Review what you discovered together
   - Praise observation skills: "You were such a great detective!"
   - Suggest next time: "Tomorrow we could hide more items and search again"
   - Return items to their normal places together

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Hide fewer items (3-4) in very obvious places
- Use simple, one-word clues: "Find the ball," "Find the cup"
- Focus on the physical searching and excitement of discovery
- Provide more direct guidance: "Look on the shelf!" or "Is it under here?"
- Keep searching time brief to maintain attention

**3-4+ years**:
- Hide more items (6-8) with more creative hiding spots
- Use detailed clues: "Find something you wear on your feet," "Find the softest thing"
- Introduce patterns: "Find two red things," "Find all the toys"
- Ask the child to suggest hiding places
- Have them create clues for you to follow
- Challenge them to find items by color, size, or category without showing the item first
- Introduce simple "detective notes" (drawing what they found)

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - I Spy Game**: Instead of hiding items, sit together and describe visible objects: "I spy with my little eye something red." The child guesses what you see. Then switch roles.

**Variation 2 - Scavenger Hunt with Pictures**: Create or print simple picture cards of items to find around a room or outdoor space. The child matches the cards to real objects.

**Repeat play**: Hide the same items in different locations. Change the number of items hidden. Have the child hide items for you to find.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated when they can't find an item quickly
**Solution**: Start with very easy, obvious hiding spots. Offer hints rather than answers. Use encouraging language: "You're searching so carefully! Let's check over here together." Remember that the journey of searching is more valuable than the discovery itself for young learners.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest partway through
**Solution**: Keep it short (15 minutes maximum). Stop while they're still enjoying it, so they want to play again tomorrow. With younger children, hide fewer items (2-3 instead of 6-8).

**Challenge**: Child wanders away from the task
**Solution**: Make it more engaging by adding sound effects, using funny voices for clues, or pretending to be different characters. Make the search more interactive by searching together rather than watching from the sidelines.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Outdoor scavenger hunt**: On a nature walk, search for specific items: "Can we find a stick? A leaf? A rock?" This extends observation skills to new environments.

2. **Memory game**: Hide several items, let the child observe them for 10 seconds, cover them with a blanket, and ask what they remember seeing. This builds memory and observation together.

3. **Daily life connections**: Point out how information gathering happens naturally: "We're investigating where your shoes went," or "Let's observe what birds do at the bird feeder."
