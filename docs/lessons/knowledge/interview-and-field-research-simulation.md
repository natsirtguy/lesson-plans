# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Interview and Field Research Simulation

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Children become young researchers and investigators, conducting simple "interviews" and collecting information from their environment using age-appropriate research methods. Kids practice asking questions, listening carefully, and recording observations through drawing, photos, or simple notes—developing early inquiry skills, communication abilities, and curiosity about the world while building confidence as learners.

## Vocabulary

**Investigate**: To look closely at something and ask questions to learn more about it. When you investigate, you're being a scientist or detective trying to discover new information (like watching how a butterfly moves or asking a friend what they like to eat).

**Observe**: To watch and pay careful attention to what you see, hear, and notice without trying to change anything. Observing means using your eyes, ears, and other senses to learn about something (like noticing that a plant grows toward the window or listening to bird sounds in the park).

**Interview**: To ask someone questions and listen to their answers to learn about their ideas, experiences, or preferences. An interview is like having a special conversation where you're curious to discover what someone thinks or knows (like asking grandma about her favorite childhood game).

**Research**: The careful work of asking questions, collecting information, and looking for answers to discover something new or learn more. Research is how scientists, historians, and curious people learn about the world (like finding out what animals live in the garden or what your family likes to do together).

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: This Old Man

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
This young researcher came one day,
Asked her questions every way,
With a listen-listen learn-and-grow,
Watch your curious questions show.

*Verse 2*
This young researcher draws with care,
Finds discoveries everywhere,
With a look-look see-and-know,
Learning all that you can show.

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Cup your hand to your ear - "listen" motion during "listen-listen"
2. Pretend to write or draw in the air during "learn-and-grow" and "look-look"
3. Spread both arms wide during "everywhere" to show big discoveries

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will practice the research and investigation skills that scientists, journalists, and curious people use every day. They'll ask simple questions, observe carefully, and record their discoveries through drawing, writing, photos, or pointing. This hands-on exploration develops communication skills, listening ability, and a love of learning while giving children their first taste of how people discover and document information.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on investigation / Social communication / Observation practice

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper or small notebook (5-8 sheets per child)
- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers
- Simple clipboard or hard surface for writing surface

**Optional**:
- Camera (smartphone or tablet) for photos
- Magnifying glass to help focus on details
- Small recording device for voice memos
- Sticky notes for marking discoveries
- Chart paper for recording findings
- Simple list of 3-4 questions (written or with pictures)

**Cost**: Free to $5 (most items already at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose 1-2 "interview subjects" (family members, pets, stuffed animals, or outdoor areas to observe)
2. Write 3-4 simple open-ended questions like "What is your favorite...?" or "What do you like to do...?"
3. Gather paper, pencils, and any recording tools
4. Clear a table space or choose an outdoor observation area

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Say: "Today we're going to be researchers and investigators, just like people who ask questions and learn about the world!"
   - Show the notebook/clipboard and explain: "These are our research tools"
   - Demonstrate asking one simple question aloud and how you'll record the answer
   - Ask: "What would you like to learn about today?"

2. **Exploration** (5-10 min):
   - Examine the notebook, pencils, and questions together
   - If observing nature, walk around and discuss what they notice: "What do you see? What looks interesting?"
   - Ask the first prepared question to the interview subject
   - Child listens carefully to the response
   - Child records the answer by drawing, writing, pointing at photos, or making marks
   - Move through 3-4 prepared questions at a comfortable pace
   - Offer prompts like "That's interesting! Can you tell me more?" or "What made you choose that?"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   - Switch roles: "Now you ask me questions!"
   - Let child explore answers that surprised or interested them
   - Continue observing and recording following the child's curiosity
   - Ask open-ended questions: "You noticed that—what else do you see?"
   - Celebrate observations: "Great watching!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   - Review the notebook together: "Look what we discovered!"
   - Ask: "What was the most interesting thing we learned?"
   - Share findings with others: "Let's tell [family member] what we researched"
   - Celebrate as researchers: "You did great research today!"
   - Help organize and put away materials

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep observations simple and short. Use one-word or very simple questions like "What color?" "What sound?" or "What's soft?" Record through photos, pointing, or simple marks rather than writing. Focus on what the child notices themselves. Keep sessions to 5-8 minutes of active observation, celebrate every discovery, and use simple language like "You saw the bird! It's flying!"

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce more complex questions and let children ask some with your support. Add simple note-taking or mapping activities. Allow interviews with multiple people and longer nature observations. Record findings in multiple ways (words and pictures together). Create simple charts like "Everyone likes..." and compare different people's answers. These children may engage 20-25 minutes or longer.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Nature Detective**
Focus entirely on outdoor observation. Examine a garden, tree, or natural area closely. What do you see, hear, and find? Create a nature discoveries chart showing all the things you found.

**Variation 2: Family Historian**
Ask family members about favorite memories, places they've lived, or things they enjoy doing. Record stories and answers. Create a simple family discoveries book with drawings and words.

**Variation 3: Pet Researcher**
Observe a family pet carefully over time. Record what it likes, when it's most active, what sounds it makes, and favorite activities. Become a pet behavior expert.

**Variation 4: Neighborhood Explorer**
Take the research outdoors to observe your neighborhood. Interview neighbors (with permission), observe buildings or natural features, and record discoveries with photos or drawings.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't ask questions or seems shy about interviewing
**Solution**: Start by asking simple questions aloud yourself while the child just listens and observes. Gradually invite them to ask one question when they're ready. Keep it playful and pressure-free. Accept pointing or nodding as participation.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or won't sit with the activity
**Solution**: Follow the child's interests—research what THEY want to learn about, not just your planned questions. Mix interview time with hands-on exploration. Make it active and movement-based rather than asking them to sit still the entire time.

**Challenge**: Child's recording method looks like scribbles or seems off-topic
**Solution**: All recording methods are valid! Scribbles are research notes. Ask your child to "read" their notes back to you. Let them lead where the investigation naturally goes instead of keeping rigid control over the process.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. Create a "researcher's notebook" folder to keep findings organized, and refer back to past discoveries in future activities: "Remember when we researched...?"
2. Share findings with family members at dinner or during family meetings, and photograph the pages to preserve the work
3. Use discoveries as conversation starters for the next research project: "What if we investigated... next time?"
