# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Interview and Field Research Simulation

## Activity Summary

Children practice real research methodology: forming a research question, choosing a data collection method, conducting structured interviews or field observations, and analyzing what they found. They learn the difference between open and closed questions, discover that the same question asked differently produces different answers, and practice treating their observations as data — information to be recorded, compared, and interpreted. This is how journalists, scientists, historians, and anthropologists actually work.

## Vocabulary

**Research question**: The specific thing you're trying to find out — the question that drives your entire investigation. Good research questions are not yes/no; they open up possibilities. You might say, "Our research question is: what do the people in our family find most challenging about mornings?"

**Primary source**: Information you get directly from the original source — an eyewitness account, a live interview, your own observation. Contrast with a secondary source (a book written by someone who wasn't there). You might say, "Asking grandma about her childhood is primary source research — she was there."

**Open question**: A question that invites explanation and can't be answered with just yes or no. Open questions produce richer data. "What do you like about the park?" is open. "Do you like the park?" is closed — it stops the conversation. You might say, "Open questions give you much more to learn from."

**Data**: The information you collect during research — observations, answers, measurements, descriptions. Field researchers record data in field notes so they can study it later. You might say, "Your drawing of what you saw is data — it captures information for later."

**Bias**: When a question or observation is shaped by what the researcher already thinks or wants to find. A biased question leads the interviewee: "Don't you love dogs?" is biased. "What do you think about dogs?" is neutral. You might say, "We try to ask questions that don't tell people what answer we expect."

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will practice the research and investigation skills that scientists, journalists, and curious people use every day. They'll ask simple questions, observe carefully, and record their discoveries through drawing, writing, photos, or pointing. This hands-on exploration develops communication skills, listening ability, and a love of learning while giving children their first taste of how people discover and document information.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on investigation / Social communication / Observation practice

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper or small notebook (5-8 sheets per child)
- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers
- Simple clipboard or hard surface for writing surface

**Optional**:
- Camera (smartphone or tablet) for photos
- Magnifying glass to help focus on details
- Small recording device for voice memos
- Sticky notes for marking discoveries
- Chart paper for recording findings
- Simple list of 3-4 questions (written or with pictures)

**Cost**: Free to $5 (most items already at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose 1-2 "interview subjects" (family members, pets, stuffed animals, or outdoor areas to observe)
2. Write 3-4 simple open-ended questions like "What is your favorite...?" or "What do you like to do...?"
3. Gather paper, pencils, and any recording tools
4. Clear a table space or choose an outdoor observation area

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Step 1 — Form the Research Question** (3-4 min):
   Begin not with "let's ask questions" but with "what are we trying to find out?" Say: "Researchers always start with a research question. It's the thing they don't know yet and want to discover. Our research question can't be answered by just looking something up — we have to go find it ourselves."

   Choose a question together. Examples that work well:
   - "What parts of the day do the people in our house find hardest or easiest?"
   - "What's outside our window and how does it change throughout the day?"
   - "What do different family members remember about being young?"

   Write or draw the research question at the top of the notebook. Say: "This is what our whole research project is about. Every question we ask and every observation we make is trying to answer this."

2. **Step 2 — Open vs. Closed Questions** (3-5 min):
   Demonstrate the difference. Ask the same thing two ways:
   - Closed: "Do you have a favorite part of the day?" (Answer: Yes/No — conversation stops)
   - Open: "What's your favorite part of the day and why?" (Answer: explanation, story, details)

   Say: "See how the open question gives us so much more to learn from? Researchers use open questions on purpose." Let the child try: "Can you make a closed question open?"

   Also demonstrate biased vs. neutral: "Isn't the morning the worst time?" vs. "What do you think about mornings?" Say: "If we already tell people what to answer, we won't learn what they actually think."

3. **Step 3 — Conduct the Interview** (8-12 min):
   Have the child conduct 3-4 open questions with a willing family member or stuffed animal. Before each question, check: "Is this an open question? Is it neutral?"

   The child draws or narrates their record of each answer in the field notebook. Teach basic field-note habits:
   - Write/draw the answer right away (not from memory later)
   - Include surprising or unexpected details
   - Write down exact words if possible ("He said 'the hardest part is getting up'")

   After each answer, prompt: "Is there anything you want to know more about? Ask a follow-up." This teaches iterative questioning — one answer generates the next question.

4. **Step 4 — Analyze the Data** (3-5 min):
   Review the field notebook together. Ask:
   - "What patterns did you notice? Did any answers surprise you?"
   - "Did everyone answer the same way, or differently?"
   - "Did you find the answer to our research question?"
   - "What new questions do you have now that you've gathered data?"

   Say: "Real researchers always end with more questions than they started with. That's normal — finding one answer opens up three more questions. That's how knowledge grows."

5. **Wrap-Up — Share Findings** (2-3 min):
   Share the findings with someone not involved in the research. Have the child explain the research question, how they found information, and what they learned. Frame it: "You just did primary source research — you went directly to the source and collected information yourself."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Simplify to field observation rather than interview. Go outside or look out a window and ask: "What do you see? What do you hear?" The research question becomes: "What lives in our yard?" Record by pointing at things, taking photos, or drawing a single observation. Narrate for them: "You just observed a worm. Let's draw it in our field notebook. That's your data — information you collected." The core concept to land: we look carefully and write down what we find.

**3-4+ years**:
Do the full protocol. Introduce the concept of bias explicitly — make it a game where you ask the same question a biased way and a neutral way and notice how the interviewee answers differently. Add a comparison: interview two different people and look for patterns or differences in their answers. This introduces the core idea that more data gives more reliable conclusions.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Nature Detective**
Focus entirely on outdoor observation. Examine a garden, tree, or natural area closely. What do you see, hear, and find? Create a nature discoveries chart showing all the things you found.

**Variation 2: Family Historian**
Ask family members about favorite memories, places they've lived, or things they enjoy doing. Record stories and answers. Create a simple family discoveries book with drawings and words.

**Variation 3: Pet Researcher**
Observe a family pet carefully over time. Record what it likes, when it's most active, what sounds it makes, and favorite activities. Become a pet behavior expert.

**Variation 4: Neighborhood Explorer**
Take the research outdoors to observe your neighborhood. Interview neighbors (with permission), observe buildings or natural features, and record discoveries with photos or drawings.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't ask questions or seems shy about interviewing
**Solution**: Start by asking simple questions aloud yourself while the child just listens and observes. Gradually invite them to ask one question when they're ready. Keep it playful and pressure-free. Accept pointing or nodding as participation.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or won't sit with the activity
**Solution**: Follow the child's interests—research what THEY want to learn about, not just your planned questions. Mix interview time with hands-on exploration. Make it active and movement-based rather than asking them to sit still the entire time.

**Challenge**: Child's recording method looks like scribbles or seems off-topic
**Solution**: All recording methods are valid! Scribbles are research notes. Ask your child to "read" their notes back to you. Let them lead where the investigation naturally goes instead of keeping rigid control over the process.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. Create a "researcher's notebook" folder to keep findings organized, and refer back to past discoveries in future activities: "Remember when we researched...?"
2. Share findings with family members at dinner or during family meetings, and photograph the pages to preserve the work
3. Use discoveries as conversation starters for the next research project: "What if we investigated... next time?"
