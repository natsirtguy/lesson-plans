# ARTS & CULTURE ACTIVITY: Interview and Journalism Play

## Activity Summary

Interview and journalism play introduces children to the role of reporter and interviewer through playful, theatrical exploration. Children will ask questions, listen to answers, and gather "information" from family members, friends, or even favorite toys in a game-like format. This activity develops communication skills, curiosity, active listening, and introduces the concept that stories and information come from asking questions and paying attention to what people share.

**Activity Type**: Communication/Social Activity/Dramatic Play

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (with natural breaks)

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Build excitement: "Today you're a reporter! A reporter asks questions to learn about people"
- Explain the role: "Reporters talk to people and ask them interesting questions. Then they share what they learned"
- Show the props: "This can be your microphone, and this is where you write down what you learn"
- Introduce the interview subject: "We're going to talk with [person name] today"

**Setting expectations**:
- The goal is to learn interesting things about the person
- Questions are a way to find out information
- The person being interviewed will answer the questions
- There are no wrong questions
- Answers can be funny, surprising, or interesting

### Main Activity (10-20 minutes)

**Phase 1: Modeling & Warm-Up** (2-3 minutes)
Demonstrate what an interview looks like
- Model asking a simple question: "What's your favorite toy?"
- Wait for answer; respond with genuine interest
- Ask a follow-up: "Why is that your favorite?"
- Show how you listen and respond to what you hear
- Invite child to help you ask the next question together

**Phase 2: Child-Led Interview** (6-12 minutes)
Child takes the reporter role
- Have child ask prepared questions or their own: "What's your favorite food?" "What makes you happy?" "What did you do today?"
- Coach gently if child gets stuck: "You could ask about..." or "What would you like to know?"
- Have interview subject answer in detail and with enthusiasm
- Encourage child to listen carefully and respond to answers
- Model follow-up questions: "That's interesting! Why?" or "Tell me more about that"
- If child is interested, take "notes" or "record" on device
- If comfortable, take a pretend photo at end of interview

**Phase 3: Free Interview Play** (remaining time)
Child continues in reporter role as they wish
- Child may want to interview another person
- Child may interview a stuffed animal or doll (equally valuable)
- Child may want to be interviewed themselves
- Child may create silly questions or scenarios
- Let play evolve naturally; child is in control

**Adult role**:
- As interview subject: answer fully and with genuine interest; expand on answers to model good conversation
- As coach: offer question suggestions if child gets stuck; avoid putting words in child's mouth
- As facilitator: keep energy positive and encouraging
- Listen actively to show child that questions and answers matter

### Wrap-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Review what was learned: "We learned that [person] loves [thing]! That's interesting!"
- Thank the interview subject with child
- Discuss child's experience: "What was your favorite thing they told you?"

**Transition to next activity**:
- If you recorded/took notes, look at them together
- Plan to share: "We can tell [another family member] what we learned!"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Approach**:
- Use very simple, concrete questions only: "What's your favorite color?" "What do you like to eat?"
- Adult should ask many of the questions with child; don't expect child to drive the whole interview
- Interview subjects should keep answers very brief and use simple language
- Focus on making it feel like a game/conversation, not a formal activity
- Use props generously to keep it playful and engaging
- Expect short attention span; 10-15 minutes is good
- Child may want to be interviewed themselves rather than interviewing others
- Interactive interview with favorite person (parent or grandparent) works best

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

**Adult support**: Very high; adult asks many questions and facilitates conversation

### 3-4+ years

**Extensions**:
- Child can ask more varied and specific questions
- Can ask follow-up questions and show curiosity about answers
- Interested in "why" questions and understanding motivations
- Can conduct multiple interviews with different people
- May want to take their own notes or drawings about what they learned
- Can interview toys/dolls with more elaborate scenarios
- Interested in sharing what they learned with others
- Can engage in back-and-forth conversation for longer
- May want to role-reverse and be interviewed as well
- Can understand that reporters share information with others

**Duration**: 20-25 minutes with multiple interviews

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1 - Family Interviews**: Interview different family members and compare their answers to the same questions

**Variation 2 - Favorite Person Profile**: Conduct in-depth interview with favorite adult or older sibling, recording their answers

**Variation 3 - Pet Interview**: Interview a family pet (through imaginative role-play) about their day and preferences

**Variation 4 - Toy Reporter**: Give a stuffed animal the reporter role; child interviews the toy or adult answers to the toy

**Variation 5 - "Reporter on the Scene"**: During a family outing, practice "reporting" observations to adults using reporter language

**Variation 6 - Interview Transcript**: Transcribe or draw pictures of interview responses; create a simple "news article" together

**Variation 7 - Guest Interview**: Invite visiting relative or family friend to be formal interview subject

**Variation 8 - Time Capsule Interview**: Record interview asking child to predict what they'll like/remember in the future

**Thematic variations**:
- Birthday interview: Ask questions about the birthday person
- Seasonal interviews: Interview others about favorite seasonal activities
- Holiday interviews: Ask about favorite holiday memories
- Community interviews: Practice with various family members or friends

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Interviewing and journalism are fundamental to how humans share stories, preserve knowledge, and build understanding across communities. In cultures worldwide, oral traditions rely on asking questions and listening to answers; journalism is a modern extension of this human practice. This activity teaches children that their questions matter, that other people's stories are worth hearing, and that communication is a two-way process. It honors the diversity of perspectives and experiences.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Interview people from different backgrounds and experiences
- Ask questions that reveal how people from different cultures celebrate or do things
- Listen to and honor different perspectives and ways of living
- Use interviews as a way to learn about family history and diverse heritage
- Celebrate that every person has an interesting story to tell
- Explore how journalists from different cultures approach storytelling

**Books/Media**:
- "Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born" by Jamie Lee Curtis (conversation and storytelling)
- "Grandpa's Teeth" by Rod Clement (funny interview-style storytelling)
- Interview format children's books: "A Series of Unfortunate Events" style narrator
- Podcasts for kids: "Brains On!" or "Story Pirates" (example of journalists/storytellers at work)

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't know what questions to ask
**Why**: Question-asking is a skill young children are still developing; they need models and suggestions
**Solution**: Provide a list of 3-5 simple questions for child to choose from. Ask questions together. Start with questions child genuinely wants to know answers to. Make it silly: "If you were a dinosaur, what would you eat?" The more absurd, sometimes the more engaging for young children.

**Challenge**: Child gets bored or distracted during interview
**Why**: Young children have limited attention spans; long interviews overwhelm them
**Solution**: Keep interviews short (10-15 minutes max). Use props to maintain engagement. Interview someone child loves and wants to learn about. Make it more like a game than a formal activity. Let child lead and control the pacing.

**Challenge**: Interview subject gives very brief answers or doesn't engage
**Why**: Some adults feel awkward or don't know how to talk to children in an interview format
**Solution**: Brief the adult beforehand on what's needed. Ask them to give detailed answers and ask child follow-up questions. Model how to do it first. Choose interview subjects who naturally enjoy talking with children. It's okay to gently coach: "Tell her more about that!"

**Challenge**: Child asks invasive or uncomfortable questions
**Why**: Young children don't yet understand social boundaries or privacy
**Solution**: Gently redirect without shame: "That's a private question. Let's ask something else." Use it as teaching moment about what's okay to ask. Practice with safe questions first. Help child develop sense of what questions are appropriate.

### Tips for Success

- **Provide question options**: Give child 3-5 questions to choose from; reduces decision paralysis
- **Start with familiar people**: Begin with close family members child loves and wants to learn about
- **Keep it conversational**: This is more like a game than a formal interview; keep the energy light
- **Model good listening**: Show genuine interest in answers; respond with follow-up questions
- **Use props**: Microphones, notebooks, and recording devices make it feel more official and engaging
- **Celebrate the questions**: "That's such a great question!" reinforces that asking is valued
- **Keep it short**: 15 minutes is plenty; better to end while interest is high
- **Make it silly**: Absurd questions ("If you could be a vegetable, what would you be?") can be most engaging

### What to Do With the Creation

- **Record the interview**: Audio or video recordings become precious keepsakes and memory preservers
- **Transcribe responses**: Write down or draw what was learned; create a simple "article" or "report"
- **Create a profile**: Combine notes/drawings into a simple profile of the interview subject
- **Share with others**: Tell another family member what was learned in the interview
- **Display questions and answers**: Post on refrigerator or in a special place
- **Compile interviews**: Over time, collect interviews with multiple people into a family book
- **Create a podcast**: Record multiple interviews and "publish" as a pretend podcast for family
