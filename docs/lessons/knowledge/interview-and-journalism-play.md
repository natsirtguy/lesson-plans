## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children take on the role of reporter to ask questions and learn about people they care about. They'll discover that asking questions is a powerful way to understand others, practice speaking and listening, and create memories by learning and sharing stories.

**Activity Type**: Communication play, dramatic role-play

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- A willing interview subject (family member, friend, or stuffed animal/doll)
- Comfortable seating for conversation

**Optional**:
- Toy microphone (or hairbrush, wooden spoon as pretend microphone)
- Paper and markers for "taking notes"
- Reporter hat or badge
- Smartphone or recording device for audio/video
- Camera for pretend photos
- Question cards with simple questions written down

**Cost**: Free (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Identify who the child will interview (family member, friend, or favorite toy)
2. Gather props if using them (hairbrush, paper, markers, toy microphone)
3. Briefly explain to the interview subject what to expect and ask them to give detailed, enthusiastic answers
4. Create a comfortable interview space with seating where you can face each other
5. Prepare 3-5 simple questions or question cards for the child (or let them create their own)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Introduce the reporter role: "Today you're a reporter! Reporters ask questions to learn about people and share interesting stories." Show the props and explain: "This can be your microphone, and this is where we write down what we learn." Build excitement: "Let's find out some cool things about [person's name]!"

2. **Exploration** (5-10 min):
   Start with a warm-up: Model asking one simple question like "What's your favorite toy?" and wait for a full answer. Show how you listen and respond with interest: "That's so cool! Why is that your favorite?" Invite the child to ask the next question together. Then let the child ask their own questions from the list or questions they create. Coach gently if stuck: "You could ask what makes them happy" or "What would you like to know about them?" Encourage the interview subject to give detailed answers.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Help the child notice what they're learning: "Did you hear that they love [thing]? That's interesting!" Encourage follow-up questions: "Tell me more about that" or "Why is that your favorite?" If desired, take simple notes or use a recording device. Point out that asking questions helps us understand people better.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Review what was learned together: "We learned that [person] loves [thing]! Wasn't that fun?" Thank the interview subject together. Discuss what the child enjoyed: "What was your favorite thing they told you?" If recording, listen back together or plan to share what you learned with another family member.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use very simple, concrete questions only: "What's your favorite color?" "What's your favorite food?" or "What do you like to play?" The adult should ask many of the questions alongside the child rather than expecting the child to lead. Keep interviews brief (10-15 minutes) and very conversational, like a game. Interview a favorite family member the child loves. Use props generously to keep it playful. The child may prefer being interviewed themselves—this is equally valuable and shows they understand the communication concept.

**3-4+ years**:
Children can ask more varied and thoughtful questions, including "why" questions and follow-ups. They're interested in understanding what makes people happy and what they like. They can conduct multiple interviews with different family members and compare answers. They may want to take their own notes or drawings about what they learned. They can interview toys and dolls with more elaborate scenarios ("Interview a dinosaur about their favorite food"). They're interested in sharing what they learned with others and may want to create a simple "news article" or "report."

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Interview different family members with the same questions and compare their answers—notice how people answer differently even when asked the same thing.

**Variation 2**: Conduct an in-depth interview with a favorite adult or older sibling, recording their complete answers to share later.

**Variation 3**: Interview a family pet through imaginative role-play, asking what their day is like and what they enjoy.

**Variation 4**: Reverse roles and let the stuffed animal or another person interview the child, helping them practice answering questions.

**Variation 5**: During a family outing or mealtime, practice "reporting" observations using reporter language: "I discovered that..."

**Variation 6**: Create a simple "interview book" by transcribing or drawing pictures of what people told you, making your own family record.

**Repeat play**: Change the interview subject each time, ask different questions, or interview the same person about different topics to keep the activity fresh.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't know what questions to ask
**Solution**: Provide a list of 3-5 simple questions for the child to choose from. Start with topics the child genuinely wants to know about (their favorite foods, toys, activities). Make it silly to boost engagement: "If you were a dinosaur, what would you eat?" Young children often respond better to absurd or playful questions.

**Challenge**: Child gets bored or distracted during the interview
**Solution**: Keep interviews short (10-15 minutes maximum). Use props to maintain engagement and make it feel official and fun. Interview someone the child loves and wants to learn about. Keep the energy light and game-like rather than formal. Follow the child's interest and allow them to control the pacing.

**Challenge**: The interview subject gives very brief answers or doesn't seem engaged
**Solution**: Gently coach the adult beforehand: "Can you give detailed answers and ask [child] follow-up questions?" Model how it's done first. Choose interview subjects who naturally enjoy talking with children. Guide the adult: "Tell them more about that!" or "That's interesting—why do you like that?"

**Challenge**: Child asks invasive or uncomfortable questions
**Solution**: Gently redirect without shame: "That's a private question. Let's ask something else instead." Use it as a teaching moment about appropriate questions. Start with safe, comfortable topics first, helping the child develop awareness of boundaries.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Record and replay**: Save audio or video recordings of interviews as precious keepsakes and memory makers. Let the child listen back and retell what they learned.

2. **Create an interview book**: Transcribe or draw pictures of what people said. Combine notes and drawings into a simple profile or "article" about the person interviewed.

3. **Share the learning**: Tell another family member what was discovered during the interview, practicing how to communicate and retell stories.

4. **Interview collection**: Over time, conduct interviews with multiple family members and create a growing family book or display of questions and answers.

5. **Practice daily**: Use interview techniques during regular conversations: "Why do you think that?" "Tell me more about your day." This reinforces the skill naturally.
