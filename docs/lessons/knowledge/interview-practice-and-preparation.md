# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Interview Practice and Preparation

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Children explore the foundations of communication through playful interview scenarios, learning to ask questions, listen attentively, and respond thoughtfully. By taking turns as both interviewer and interviewee with an adult or peer, children develop confidence in conversation, practice turn-taking, and build understanding that structured dialogue is a way to learn about others and share information.

## Vocabulary

**Interview**: A structured conversation where one person asks purposeful questions to gather information or understand another person's knowledge, opinions, or experience. Journalists use interviews to report news; scientists use them to collect data; employers use them to evaluate candidates; doctors use them to understand symptoms.

**Open-ended question**: A question that invites a full, personal answer — not just yes or no. "What did you like about the park?" is open-ended. It gives the other person space to share real information. Compare to "Did you like the park?" — which can be answered with one word and tells you almost nothing. Open-ended questions are the interviewer's most important tool.

**Closed question**: A question with a short, fixed answer — yes/no or a single fact. "Is your name Max?" and "How old are you?" are closed questions. Useful for confirming facts, but not for learning about someone's thoughts or experiences.

**Follow-up question**: A question you ask based on what someone just said, to dig deeper or clarify. If someone says "I like dogs," a follow-up question might be "What kind of dog? What do you like about them?" Good interviewers listen carefully and follow up — it shows real interest and gets richer answers.

**Active listening**: Showing the speaker you're genuinely paying attention — through eye contact, nodding, short responses ("Oh really? Tell me more"), and paraphrasing ("So you're saying you liked the big slide the best?"). Active listening makes people feel heard and encourages them to share more.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

This hands-on activity introduces children to structured conversation through guided interview practice. Children take turns asking questions and providing answers in a playful, low-pressure environment, building confidence with verbal expression, listening skills, and social interaction. The activity develops fundamental communication patterns that children will use throughout their lives.

**Activity Type**: Communication/Social skill practice

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Notepad or clipboard (1-2) - for "recording" responses (can be pretend)
- Pencil or marker - for writing or marking paper
- Comfortable seating or carpet area - for face-to-face conversation

**Optional**:
- Picture cards or objects (5-8 items) - to use as conversation topics
- Stuffed animals or puppets (2-3) - for role-playing and modeling
- Dress-up props (hat, glasses, briefcase) - to help children feel like interviewers
- Toy microphone or paper towel tube microphone - adds playfulness
- Recording device (phone or tablet) - children enjoy "recording" themselves

**Cost**: Free to Under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather interview materials (notepad, pencil, props if using) and place in accessible location
2. Choose 4-6 simple, open-ended questions appropriate for the child's age
3. Clear the play space and arrange two comfortable seating positions facing each other or in a small circle
4. Keep distractions minimal by putting away other toys
5. Ensure good lighting and comfortable temperature for a calm, inviting space

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Start with enthusiasm and show the materials. Introduce the concept: "Today we're going to be interviewers! We get to ask questions and hear interesting stories." Demonstrate with a stuffed animal or puppet if available - ask the toy a simple question ("What is your favorite color?") and answer in a funny voice. Explain that "we take turns asking and listening, and there are no wrong answers - everyone's answers are special and interesting."

2. **Exploration** (8-12 minutes):
   **Teach open vs. closed questions explicitly.** Say: "There are two kinds of questions. A closed question gets a short answer — like 'Do you like cats?' I can just say yes or no and we're done. An open-ended question gets a real answer — like 'What do you like about cats?' Tell me why." Demonstrate both with the same topic and compare the answers.

   Then model a real interview: ask the child a closed question ("Do you like dinosaurs?") — get a yes — and narrate: "See, I don't know much. Let me ask open-ended: 'What's your favorite thing about dinosaurs?'" Listen to the fuller answer, then ask a follow-up question based on what they said: "Oh — why do you think T. rex had such short arms?"

   Now let the child interview you. If they ask a closed question, gently show the difference: "You asked 'Do you like music?' — I can just say yes! What if you asked 'What kind of music do you like?' — then I'd have a lot more to say." Help them rephrase if they want to.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   Try a short "real interview" — one person interviews the other about a topic they genuinely know (their favorite game, their pet, what happened yesterday). Practice active listening: after the answer, the interviewer paraphrases ("So you're saying the best part was when the dog jumped in the puddle?") and asks a follow-up. Switch roles.

   Ask reflective questions: "Which kind of question got you more information? What made that answer really interesting to hear? Did you think of a follow-up question when they were talking?"

4. **Wrap-Up** (2-3 minutes):
   Connect to the real world: "Journalists who write news stories use interviews to find out what really happened. Scientists interview people to learn about their experiences. Doctors ask patients open-ended questions to understand what's wrong. You practiced real interviewing today — asking questions that invite real answers, and listening carefully enough to follow up." Review the best question they asked.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use very simple one-word or two-word answer questions (What's your name? What do you like? What's this?). Rely heavily on modeling and demonstration with puppets and props - this age responds better to concrete objects. Accept very brief answers or non-verbal responses and focus more on the turn-taking structure than the content of answers. Keep verbal explanations minimal and duration to 10-15 minutes.

**3-4+ years**:
Ask more open-ended questions that require longer answers and introduce follow-up questions ("Why do you like that? Can you tell me more?"). Encourage the child to ask more complex questions, introduce the concept of "learning about someone" through questioning, and record responses on paper while the child watches. Can extend activities to 25+ minutes as older preschoolers engage longer. Do interviews with family members or other children for extended practice.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Interview Different Characters**: Use different stuffed animals, puppets, or family members as interview subjects. Create silly characters with funny voices and personalities. Children can ask the same questions to different "people" and compare answers.

**Variation 2 - Reporter Theme**: Create a pretend news station where the child is a news reporter interviewing people about what's happening around the house or yard. Use a toy microphone and "broadcast" findings to family members.

**Variation 3 - Question Cards with Pictures**: Create or print simple picture cards showing common interview questions with illustrations (What do you like to eat? What's your favorite activity? Who is your friend?). Children pick cards to ask.

**Variation 4 - Job Interview Play**: For older 3-4 year olds, introduce the concept of "job interviews." The child can interview an adult or stuffed animal for a pretend job (veterinarian, chef, teacher, doctor) and ask questions like "Why do you want this job? What's your special skill?"

**Repeat play**: Keep the activity fresh by varying the interview subjects, changing the props and dress-up items, introducing new question topics, and connecting interviews to the child's current interests or seasonal themes (holiday traditions, favorite rainy day activities, what animals do in different seasons).

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't answer questions or gives very short responses
**Solution**: Don't push for longer answers. Ask yes/no questions first to build confidence. Model answers by answering questions yourself. Use props or picture prompts to give context. Accept one-word answers as complete and valid. Practice will build comfort over time.

**Challenge**: Child keeps asking the same question repeatedly
**Solution**: Answer the question again with genuine enthusiasm each time - this is developmentally appropriate and shows they're enjoying the activity. After a few repetitions, you might gently ask, "What else would you like to know?" Repetition is how young children learn and feel secure.

**Challenge**: Child monopolizes the conversation and doesn't listen to your answers
**Solution**: Gently redirect with "My turn to talk now. I want to tell you about..." Use visual signals like holding up a hand or using the microphone prop to show whose turn it is. Praise good listening when the child does attend.

**Challenge**: The activity gets silly or off-topic very quickly
**Solution**: Follow their lead - there's no "wrong" way to interview with young children. If a stuffed animal gives silly answers or the topic wanders, that's perfect. The goal is practicing conversation and turn-taking, not following formal interview rules.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest after a few minutes
**Solution**: Keep first sessions short (10 minutes). Make it playful rather than serious. Include props and puppets for variety. If energy dips, suggest a brief movement break or transition to different play.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Connect to Real Life**: After practicing interviews, point out interviews in everyday life - "The teacher is asking us about our weekend - that's like an interview! Notice how she's listening carefully?"

2. **Extend to Family**: Encourage the child to interview family members using the same structure. This reinforces the skill and lets them practice with different people.

3. **Create Documentation**: Save the "interview notes" by displaying them on the refrigerator or in a special book. Let the child "listen back" to any recordings and relive the conversation.
