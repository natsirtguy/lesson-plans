# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Investment and Savings Games

## 🎯 Activity Summary

In this activity, children learn foundational concepts about earning, saving, spending, and growing money through playful, hands-on games using pretend money, tokens, or real (supervised) coins. Children engage in economic decision-making, delayed gratification, and understand that resources can grow over time when managed thoughtfully. This activity builds early financial literacy while developing math skills, planning abilities, and understanding of value and trade.

## Vocabulary

**Investment**: Resources (like money or time) that you put into something now, expecting it to help you in the future. When you save tokens in the bank, you're making an investment in getting something you want later.

**Savings**: Money or resources that you set aside and keep safe instead of spending right away. Your savings can grow bigger and help you buy bigger things.

**Transaction**: An exchange where you trade something (like money) for something else (like a toy or snack). A transaction is a fair trade between two people.

**Delayed Gratification**: Choosing to wait for something you want, even though you could have it right now. When you wait to save enough tokens for the special toy, you're practicing delayed gratification.

**Interest**: Extra money that a bank or savings account adds to your savings over time. The bank pays you interest because it uses your saved money while you're not spending it. That's why "money grows" when you save it — interest keeps adding a little more.

**Opportunity Cost**: The thing you give up when you make a choice. If you spend your tokens on a small toy, the opportunity cost is that you can't buy the bigger toy later. Every spending choice has an opportunity cost.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
The little piggy bank saves coins so bright,
Money grows when you put it away,
Soon you'll have enough to buy something nice,
The little piggy bank grows day by day.

*Verse 2*
You can spend your money today,
Or save it for tomorrow's treat,
Both choices are good ones to make,
When you plan before you spend or eat.

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Pretend to drop coins into a piggy bank (hand-over-hand motion)

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will engage in structured play involving earning, spending, and saving pretend money. They'll make real economic decisions about whether to purchase immediately or save for bigger rewards, while learning about delayed gratification, value, and financial planning through hands-on transactions and game play.

**Activity Type**: Practical and economic decision-making through play

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Pretend play money (paper bills or coins, or printed play money)
- Alternative tokens (buttons, beads, blocks, or poker chips) - 50-100 pieces per child
- Small containers or pouches for "savings" (cups, small bowls, fabric pouches)
- Simple items to "purchase" or trade for (toy figures, small blocks, snacks, stickers)
- Price labels or cards (can be handwritten or printed)

**Optional**:
- Toy cash register or counting tray
- Piggy bank or decoration for savings container
- Chart paper for tracking savings progress
- Pictures of things they might "save for" (bicycle, toy, special treat)
- Simple counting or number cards (1-10)

**Cost**: Free to $5 (most materials from household items or can be printed)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather or print pretend money/tokens - enough for multiple transactions per child
2. Create price tags for 3-5 simple items or activities (realistic prices: 5-15 tokens each)
3. Set up small containers labeled "My Savings" and "To Spend Today"
4. Arrange items for "purchase" or select activities and place at accessible height
5. Create defined areas: "Shop," "Savings Bank," and personal workspace for each child

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (3-5 minutes):
   Introduce the concept: "Today we're going to be smart shoppers and money managers! We'll have pretend money that we can spend on things we want, or save for something even bigger. What do YOU want to do?" Show the "shop" with available items and their prices. Demonstrate putting money into a savings container: "Watch - I'm putting some of my money here where it stays safe. Later, I can use it for something special." Set clear expectations: money is for trading, spending all now means none for later, and both spending and saving are okay choices.

2. **Exploration** (5-10 minutes):
   Each child receives their starting "money" and freely explores: examining coins/bills, counting, organizing, and looking at the shop items. Introduce the prices and what different amounts can buy. Demonstrate decision-making aloud: "I have 20 tokens. This toy costs 5 tokens. If I buy it, I'll have 15 left. What will I do with my remaining tokens?" Invite each child to make one purchase decision - will they spend now or save? What will they buy? How much will they have left? Ask questions: "How much money do you have left? Could you buy something else? Why did you choose to save?" Children count out money, trade with the "shopkeeper," take their item or make their choice, and observe what's left.

3. **Discovery** (7-10 minutes):
   Children continue making purchase and saving decisions at their own pace. Introduce interest by name: "Every few minutes, people who saved money get a bonus called **interest**! Real banks do this too — they add extra money to your savings because they're using your money while it sits there." Add a few extra tokens to savings containers and count the new total together. Allow multiple rounds of earning, saving, and purchasing. Introduce opportunity cost explicitly: "You chose the small toy now — what's the opportunity cost? What can't you buy anymore?" Children who finish early can help run the shop, count total savings, set new goals, or teach a friend. Encourage conversation: "Tell me about your money decisions. What was your opportunity cost?"

4. **Wrap-Up** (3-5 minutes):
   Count everyone's savings together and share amounts. Ask: "Who saved the most? Did you spend money or save it? What was hard? What was fun?" Make cleanup part of the economic lesson: "Let's count all the tokens as we put them back. We want to make sure we have all our money accounted for." Children help sort money back into containers. Celebrate: "You took care of our money very carefully!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Simplify to basic cause-and-effect: Money → Purchase. Use only 2-3 items for "purchase" to avoid overwhelming choices. Focus on the sensory experience of handling money and trading. Very short rounds (2-3 transactions maximum per child). Reduce quantities to 10-15 tokens per child. Frame as pure play and trading, not yet about saving for later. Caregiver does most shopkeeping while child focuses on trading. Keep duration to 10-15 minutes with frequent breaks. Provide high support with hand-over-hand counting and frequent verbal celebration.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce delayed gratification explicitly: "If you save for 2 more rounds, you can buy the BIG toy." Add value complexity: "This costs 10 tokens OR 2 big tokens." Create tiered rewards: Small purchase = 5 tokens, Medium = 15 tokens, Premium = 30 tokens. Introduce "earning" rounds: "Everyone who helped clean up earns 5 bonus tokens." Add interest: "All saved money earns 1 extra interest token each turn — just like a real bank!" Have children role-play as shopkeepers. Create a "savings goal" chart with pictures. Introduce "jobs" to earn money: Organize blocks, count items, help a friend. Play multiple rounds with running totals. Duration can extend to 25-30 minutes or longer for engaged learners.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Time-Limited Shopping**
Set a timer for when the "shop" closes. Children must decide quickly whether to shop now or save. Adds urgency and real-world planning.

**Variation 2: Auction Game**
Items have variable prices based on "demand." Popular items cost more if multiple children want them. Teaches value and negotiation.

**Variation 3: Cooperative Savings Goal**
Everyone saves toward a GROUP goal (20 tokens = shared snack time, or group outing). Teaches teamwork and shared responsibility.

**Variation 4: Job Board**
Create a "job" station where children can earn tokens: Sort buttons, build a tower, sing a song, find items. Connects saving/earning directly.

**Variation 5: Seasonal Savings Drives**
"Holiday coming! Everyone save for a special gift" or "Save for a field trip snack." Frames savings around meaningful goals.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to spend ALL money immediately and won't save.
**Solution**: Don't force saving. Celebrate their choice. Try framing saving as game strategy ("Let's see if we can get 20 in your bank by tomorrow") rather than moral duty. Some children naturally prefer immediate joy.

**Challenge**: Child gets upset when money "runs out" after spending.
**Solution**: Offer a gentle do-over with new money. Ask: "What would you do differently?" Normalize both emotions. Next round, offer to help them "plan" before spending.

**Challenge**: Conflict over fairness ("He got more money than me!" or "I wanted that toy!").
**Solution**: Acknowledge feelings: "You're frustrated you couldn't get that toy. There are other toys you might like." If needed, rotate special items or have duplicates. Use this as a teaching moment.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand the exchange transaction.
**Solution**: Use concrete language and repetition: "You're trading 5 tokens for this toy. The toy is now yours. You have 5 fewer tokens." Let child handle and count through each transaction.

**Challenge**: One child dominates transactions or being shopkeeper.
**Solution**: Set clear turn-taking: "Everyone gets to be shopkeeper for 3 customers." Rotate roles explicitly. Support less assertive children in speaking up.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Real-World Connection**: Take this learning to the grocery store or a favorite shop. Let your child observe how money works in the real world - people choose what to buy, pay, and make choices about spending.

2. **Savings Goal Chart**: Create a visual chart at home where your child can track progress toward a real savings goal (a toy they want, an outing, etc.). Mark progress daily or weekly and celebrate reaching milestones.

3. **Family Money Conversations**: Share your own money decisions with your child. "I want new shoes, but first I need to save enough money." Let them see that financial decision-making is a lifelong skill.
