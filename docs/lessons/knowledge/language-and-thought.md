# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Language and Thought

## Activity Summary

Children discover how words help us think and understand the world around us through playful language exploration, rhyming games, and naming activities. They'll learn that language is a powerful tool for remembering, sharing ideas, and solving problems—understanding that what we think and what we say are deeply connected.

## Vocabulary

**Cognition**: The mental process of knowing, thinking, and understanding. Your brain is always doing cognition — noticing things, making sense of them, remembering them. Language is one of the most powerful tools your brain uses for cognition.

**Symbol**: Something that stands for or represents something else. Words are symbols — the sound "dog" isn't a dog, but it makes us think of one. All languages use symbols to point to things in the world.

**Inner Speech**: The voice inside your head that talks while you think. When you're puzzling something out ("hmm, where did I put my shoe?"), that's inner speech — you're using language to think, even without making a sound.

**Linguistic Relativity**: The idea that the words you know affect how you think and notice things. If you have a word for something, you see it more clearly. Some languages have many words for snow; speakers of those languages notice different kinds of snow that others might not see at all.

**Communicate**: To share your thoughts, feelings, or ideas with other people using words, sounds, or gestures.

**Express**: To show or tell what you're thinking or feeling in words or actions.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes

**Tempo**: Moderate and thoughtful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Think and talk, express yourself, express yourself
Think and talk, express yourself, express yourself
Words and thoughts have a connection
Think and talk, communicate, communicate

*Verse 2*
Use your words to imagine things, imagine things
Use your words to imagine things, imagine things
Express your feelings and your thoughts
Make that connection now, connection now

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point to head when singing "think" and to mouth when singing "talk"
2. Open hands outward from chest when singing "express"
3. Bring hands together to show connection between thinking and speaking

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore how words and thinking are connected through symbol play, inner speech activities, and the "new word, new world" game (a simple demonstration of linguistic relativity). They discover that words are symbols that point to things, that thinking often uses language even silently, and that learning new words actually helps them notice new things — their thinking changes when their vocabulary grows.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on discovery with symbol play and language experiments

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper or whiteboard
- Markers or crayons (washable)
- Picture cards (animals, foods, objects from around the house—can be printed or hand-drawn)
- A familiar toy or object the child loves

**Optional**:
- Thought bubble templates (simple cloud shapes printed on paper)
- Small objects for sorting (blocks, buttons, toys)
- Camera or phone to take photos of the child's creations
- Speech bubble cutouts

**Cost**: Free to $5 (using materials you likely have at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather 5-8 picture cards or small objects that are familiar to the child (apple, dog, car, ball, sun, flower, etc.)
2. Have paper and markers ready on a low table where the child can reach comfortably
3. Safety check: Ensure markers are washable and non-toxic; verify all objects are choking-hazard safe for the child's age

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction — Words Are Symbols** (2-3 min):
   Hold up a picture of a dog (or a toy dog). Say: "This picture is a symbol — it stands for a real dog. And the word 'dog' is also a symbol! It's just a sound, but it makes your brain think of a real dog. Every word you know is a symbol that points to something." Try it: say "apple" without showing anything. "Did you think of an apple? That's a symbol working! Your brain already knows what 'apple' means, so the word alone is enough."

2. **Exploration — Inner Speech** (5-7 min):
   - Introduce inner speech: "Did you know that when you think really hard, your brain talks to itself? That's called **inner speech** — a little voice inside your head."
   - Model it aloud: "Watch me think out loud. 'Hmm... where did I put the bear? I think it was near the blocks. Let me look there.' I was using words inside my head to figure it out — that's inner speech turned outside!"
   - Try it together: Ask the child to think about where their favorite toy lives in the house. Encourage them to whisper their thinking. "Did your brain use words? Did you say in your head where it is?"
   - Point out: "Animals communicate too, but human language lets us think about things that aren't here right now — like your grandma, or tomorrow, or a dragon. That's something special about words and cognition."

3. **Discovery — The New Word Game (Linguistic Relativity)** (3-5 min):
   Go outside or look out a window at the sky. Say: "I'm going to teach you a word, and then you'll see if you notice something new." Teach: **"cumulus"** — the big, puffy kind of cloud. "Cumulus clouds look like cotton balls piled up. Can you find a cumulus cloud?" After they find one, say: "Now that you know the word 'cumulus,' you'll notice cumulus clouds all the time. Before you knew the word, they were just 'clouds.' Now your brain has a sharper thought! That's linguistic relativity — words change how you see the world." If inside, do the same with an unusual color word (e.g., "magenta" for a pink-purple), or a texture word (e.g., "translucent" — you can see light through it, like a window).

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Review: "Today we learned that words are **symbols** that point to things. That your brain uses **inner speech** — words — to think, even silently. And that learning new words like **cumulus** or **translucent** actually changes what you notice — that's **linguistic relativity**." Ask: "What new word did you learn today? Can you find that thing right now?"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on the symbol concept: hold up objects and say "This word is a symbol for this thing — 'cup'! The word 'cup' makes your brain think of a cup." Name objects together and marvel at symbols. For inner speech, simply say "I'm thinking in my head — shhh, my brain is talking!" and then announce what you were thinking. Skip the linguistic relativity game and instead teach one fancy new word for something they see every day (e.g., "That's a **petal** on the flower").

**3-4+ years**:
Dive deeper into the new-word game: after teaching "cumulus," teach a second cloud type ("**stratus**" — flat, gray, layer-like) and have them distinguish between the two. Discuss: "Before you knew these words, were they both just 'clouds'?" Ask them to think about times they couldn't explain something because they didn't have the word. Introduce the idea that different languages have different words — some languages have many words for "snow" because snow is very important where those people live. Ask: "What things do you notice a lot that might need more words?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Symbol Hunt**: Walk around the house or neighborhood naming things. Point out that every word you say is a symbol: "I said 'door' and your brain immediately knew what I meant — that's a symbol working!" Challenge: can they think of a thing they don't have a word for? (This is a real philosophical puzzle — and young children sometimes find it!)

**Variation 2 - New Word, New World**: Each day this week, teach one precise vocabulary word for something in the environment: **translucent** (window, glass), **cumulus** (puffy cloud), **texture** (rough bark, smooth stone), **symmetry** (butterfly wings, your face). Ask at bedtime: "Did you notice any [word] today?" Track how often they spot the thing now that they have a word for it.

**Variation 3 - Thinking Out Loud**: Model inner speech by narrating your problem-solving aloud: "Hmm, I need to figure out how to fit this toy in the bag. Let me think... maybe if I turn it sideways..." Ask the child to do the same with a simple puzzle or block task. Discuss: "What did your brain say while you were thinking?"

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't respond verbally or seems to not understand what "thinking" means.

**Solution**: This is developmentally normal. Thinking is invisible, which makes it abstract and tricky for young minds. Instead of asking "What are you thinking?" point to objects and model thinking aloud: "I think this is a dog. I think it's brown." Accept any response—pointing, gestures, or sounds—as evidence of thinking. The child is connecting the concept even if they can't articulate it yet.

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated with drawing or expressing thoughts in "adult" ways.

**Solution**: Stop requiring specific outputs. Some children communicate thinking through actions, not words or drawings. If the child wants to act out their thoughts (pretend play with toys) or show you through movement, that's perfectly valid. Follow the child's lead and narrate what you see: "You're showing me that the bear is dancing! What a wonderful thought you had about the bear dancing!"

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Narration**: Throughout the day, narrate your own thinking aloud: "I'm thinking we should have a snack. I think grapes sound yummy." This models how thinking becomes talking and helps children absorb the connection naturally.

2. **Question-of-the-Day**: Each morning or during a car ride, ask: "What are you thinking about today?" or "What do you think about [something they see]?" Make it a routine so children practice expressing thoughts regularly.

3. **Story Connection**: When reading picture books, pause and ask: "What do you think will happen next?" or "What do you think this character is thinking?" This connects language, thought, and imagination in a meaningful context they already love.
