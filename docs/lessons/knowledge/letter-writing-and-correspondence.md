# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Letter writing and correspondence

## Activity Summary

Letter writing and correspondence is a meaningful creative communication activity where children explore written expression, mark-making, and the joy of sending messages to others. Through creating letters, cards, or simple written and pictorial messages, young children develop fine motor skills, understand symbolic communication, and experience the special feeling of connecting with loved ones. This activity bridges artistic expression with real-world communication, making writing feel purposeful and exciting.

## Vocabulary

**Correspondence**: The act of writing letters and messages to send to other people. When you and your grandma write letters back and forth to each other, that's correspondence—it's like talking on paper.

**Symbolic**: Using marks, drawings, or pictures to stand for something else. When you draw a circle with dots and call it a face, you're using symbolic marks—the circle represents a head.

**Expression**: Showing your feelings, ideas, or thoughts through art, words, movements, or creativity. When you paint a picture of a sunny day because it makes you happy, that's creative expression.

**Recipient**: The person who receives a letter or gift. When you draw a picture and send it to your friend, your friend is the recipient—they get to enjoy what you created.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: The Itsy Bitsy Spider

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 4-6 lines each):

*Verse 1*
I take my paper, pick my color bright
I'll make some marks and lines across the page
My scribbles are a letter that I write
To tell someone that they're special, they're engaged
I color it with yellow, blue, and green
The prettiest letter they have ever seen

*Verse 2*
I fold my paper carefully in place
I put it in an envelope so neat
I seal it with a sticker on the base
And soon my letter will be someone's treat
I'll mail it to the person that I love
A message like a hug from high above

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Pretend to draw on paper with your fingers
2. Fold your hands together gently (like folding a letter)
3. Make a mailbox shape with your arms and "post" the letter

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will explore the concept of sending messages to others through creative mark-making and drawings. They'll create their own letters using paper, markers, crayons, and other materials, then experience the joy of "mailing" their creation. This hands-on experience develops fine motor skills, introduces symbolic communication, and makes written expression feel purposeful and meaningful.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression, Communication practice, Fine motor skill-building

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper or card stock (various colors and sizes)
- Crayons, markers, or colored pencils
- Envelopes or folded cardstock (for mailing effect)
- Simple stickers or stamps

**Optional**:
- Glue stick and tissue paper
- Watercolor paints and brushes
- Decorative stickers or embellishments
- Old magazines for cutting and collage
- Ink pads for fingerprints

**Cost**: Free to $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all writing and marking materials in easy-reach containers
2. Set out paper in different colors at a low child-height table
3. Create a small mailbox or envelope holder for finished letters
4. Decide who the letters might be "sent to" (family member, friend, pet, or character)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Introduce the concept of letters and correspondence. Show a real envelope or card and talk about how we send letters to people we care about. Ask: "Who would you like to send a letter to?" Explain that their letter can have pictures, scribbles, stickers, or marks—anything showing what they're thinking. Demonstrate mark-making: "Watch me make some marks on this paper. These marks are like a letter!"

2. **Exploration** (5-10 minutes):
   Child chooses paper color and begins free exploration of mark-making. Encourage them to freely scribble, color, and explore different marking tools. Let them work at their own pace with no pressure to create anything "correctly." Observe their mark-making style and tool preferences.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   Ask guiding questions about their creation: "Tell me about your marks—who is this letter for?" "What colors did you use?" If they want to add stickers, decorations, or paint, offer those materials. Celebrate their work with specific, genuine praise: "I see so many yellow marks!" or "You used lots of different colors!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   Gather finished letters and admire each one. Ask each child to tell you about their letter. Talk about how special it will be for the recipient. Place letters in the special mailbox or envelope. Take a photo if desired to remember the experience.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on mark-making and exploration rather than "real" letter writing. Provide large crayons (easier to grip) and thick markers on larger paper. Use shorter activity time (10-15 minutes). Focus on the joy of making marks rather than making it look like something. Let them repeat the same actions without direction. Offer high adult support and frequent verbal encouragement.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce the idea of "writing" their name or simple letters and shapes. Encourage drawing recognizable images and suggest themes: "Draw something that makes you happy to send." Add collage elements (stickers, cut paper) for more complexity. Discuss what message they're sending. They can work longer (20-30 minutes) and attempt more detailed letters.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Treasure hunt letter. Hide small drawings or clues throughout the letter for the receiver to find. Child draws pictures of items, then makes a simple map showing where treasures are hidden.

**Variation 2**: Paint and splatter letters. Use watercolors, food coloring water, or washable paint instead of markers. Child paints their letter, splatters colors, or creates texture with brushes.

**Variation 3**: Letter to a character. Focus the letter on someone specific and imaginary—a storybook character, stuffed animal, or fantasy friend. Child creates a letter to them, drawing pictures of things that character likes.

**Repeat play**: Use thematic variations like holiday letters (seasonal colors), thank you notes (gratitude focus), birthday letters (celebratory), or nature mail (made from natural materials).

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't know what to "write" or what their marks should represent.

**Solution**: Reframe from "writing a letter" to "making a picture and marks for someone." Explain: "Your colorful marks ARE the letter—that's how you're telling them about your ideas." Accept any marks, scribbles, or drawings as valid. Comment on what you observe rather than asking "what is it?"

**Challenge**: Child tears paper, has difficulty holding writing tools, or gets frustrated with fine motor tasks.

**Solution**: Use thicker paper (cardstock) that's harder to tear. Provide chunky crayons instead of thin markers. Use hand-over-hand guidance if needed. Keep activity time shorter. Normalize accidents: "Sometimes paper tears—that's okay! We can keep going."

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or wants to move on after brief engagement.

**Solution**: Shorter activity time is perfectly fine—even 5 minutes of mark-making is successful. For those wanting more engagement, rotate through different materials (crayons, then stickers, then paint) to maintain interest. Accept that attention spans vary by age and temperament.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Deliver the letter**: Mail the letter to the intended recipient or deliver it in person. Receiving their letter makes children feel accomplished and connected.

2. **Create a letter collection**: Keep letters in a special folder or box by year or age. Over time, you'll see how their mark-making develops—a beautiful record of growth.

3. **Connect to daily life**: Point out when letters arrive in your mailbox. Talk about who sent them and what messages they carry. Discuss how mail carriers help people stay connected.
