# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Letter writing and correspondence

## Activity Summary

Letter writing and correspondence is a meaningful creative communication activity where children explore written expression, mark-making, and the joy of sending messages to others. Through creating letters, cards, or simple written and pictorial messages, young children develop fine motor skills, understand symbolic communication, and experience the special feeling of connecting with loved ones. This activity bridges artistic expression with real-world communication, making writing feel purposeful and exciting.

## Vocabulary

**Correspondence**: The act of writing letters and messages to send to other people. When you and your grandma write letters back and forth to each other, that's correspondence — it's like talking on paper, except both people can keep the words forever.

**Symbolic**: Using marks, drawings, or pictures to stand for something else. All writing is symbolic — the letter "A" doesn't look like an apple, but we all agree it represents that sound. When humans first started writing, they used pictographs: little pictures that stood for words (a drawing of a sun meant "sun"). Over thousands of years, those pictures became the abstract letters of our alphabet.

**Salutation**: The greeting at the start of a letter: "Dear Grandma," or "Hello, Friend." The word comes from the Latin word for "health" — saying hello used to mean wishing someone good health. Every formal letter has a salutation, a body (the message), and a closing ("Love," or "Sincerely").

**Postage**: Payment that covers the cost of delivering a letter. A stamp on an envelope shows that postage has been paid. Before postage stamps were invented (1840, in Britain), the person who RECEIVED the letter had to pay — not the sender!

**Postal System / Infrastructure**: The network of people, vehicles, sorting machines, and buildings that moves letters from one place to another. Your letter travels through sorting facilities, may go on trucks or planes, and is delivered by a mail carrier — all to reach one specific person.

**Recipient**: The person who receives a letter or message. The recipient's name and address on the envelope tells the postal system exactly where to deliver it.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: The Itsy Bitsy Spider

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 4-6 lines each):

*Verse 1*
I take my paper, pick my color bright
I'll make some marks and lines across the page
My scribbles are a letter that I write
To tell someone that they're special, they're engaged
I color it with yellow, blue, and green
The prettiest letter they have ever seen

*Verse 2*
I fold my paper carefully in place
I put it in an envelope so neat
I seal it with a sticker on the base
And soon my letter will be someone's treat
I'll mail it to the person that I love
A message like a hug from high above

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Pretend to draw on paper with your fingers
2. Fold your hands together gently (like folding a letter)
3. Make a mailbox shape with your arms and "post" the letter

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will explore the concept of sending messages to others through creative mark-making and drawings. They'll create their own letters using paper, markers, crayons, and other materials, then experience the joy of "mailing" their creation. This hands-on experience develops fine motor skills, introduces symbolic communication, and makes written expression feel purposeful and meaningful.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression, Communication practice, Fine motor skill-building

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper or card stock (various colors and sizes)
- Crayons, markers, or colored pencils
- Envelopes or folded cardstock (for mailing effect)
- Simple stickers or stamps

**Optional**:
- Glue stick and tissue paper
- Watercolor paints and brushes
- Decorative stickers or embellishments
- Old magazines for cutting and collage
- Ink pads for fingerprints

**Cost**: Free to $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all writing and marking materials in easy-reach containers
2. Set out paper in different colors at a low child-height table
3. Create a small mailbox or envelope holder for finished letters
4. Decide who the letters might be "sent to" (family member, friend, pet, or character)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction — How Humans Learned to Write Messages** (2-3 minutes):
   Show a real envelope or letter. Say: "Humans have been sending messages to each other for thousands of years. At first, there was no alphabet — people drew pictures to communicate. That's called a **pictograph**." Draw a simple sun, a person, and a wavy line (water) on paper and tell a little story with them. "Over time, those pictures became simpler and more abstract until they became the letters we use today. Every letter you write uses a symbolic system that humans invented and improved for thousands of years." Ask: "Who would you like to send a letter to today?"

2. **Exploration — Anatomy of a Letter** (5-10 minutes):
   Before creating, examine a real letter or envelope together:
   - Point to the address: "This tells the postal system exactly who gets this letter and where they live."
   - Point to the stamp: "This is **postage** — it shows we've paid for the letter's journey. Before stamps existed (they were invented in 1840!), the RECEIVER had to pay."
   - If there's a postmark (the ink mark stamped over the stamp): "This **postmark** shows when and where the letter was mailed."
   Now write a letter together. Use the real structure: start with a **salutation** ("Dear [Name],"), write the body (pictures, marks, dictated words), and end with a closing ("Love, [Name]"). Even scribbles count as the body — say: "Your scribbles are your symbolic message. We know they mean something special."

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   Ask guiding questions:
   - "How does your letter get from here to your grandma's house? Who carries it?" (Explain the postal route briefly)
   - "Why do we write letters instead of just calling on the phone?" (Writing lasts — you can read a letter years later; phone calls disappear)
   - "Did you know that people have found letters written on clay tablets thousands of years ago? They're still readable today!"
   - "If this envelope had no address, what would happen to your letter?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   Address the envelope together (help child "write" or stamp the recipient's name and address). Add a stamp. Talk about the letter's journey: "It will go in a mailbox, to a sorting facility, maybe onto a truck or airplane, and then a mail carrier will bring it right to [recipient's] door."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on mark-making and the pictograph concept — draw a simple picture together and say "This is a symbol for [person/thing]. That's how the very first writing worked!" Write the salutation yourself while saying it aloud ("I'm writing 'Dear Grandma' — that's the salutation, the hello"). Let them draw/scribble the body. After, show the stamp and say "postage" — this is what makes the letter travel. Keep duration to 10-15 minutes.

**3-4+ years**:
Extend the history: look up a simple image of Egyptian hieroglyphs or ancient pictographs online and compare them to modern letters. "Can you see the picture hiding inside the letter?" Try writing their name and discuss how each letter is a symbol. Introduce the full address format on the envelope and discuss why each part matters (name, street, city, country — layers of location, like zooming out on a map). Ask: "How would a letter find you if you had no address?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Treasure hunt letter. Hide small drawings or clues throughout the letter for the receiver to find. Child draws pictures of items, then makes a simple map showing where treasures are hidden.

**Variation 2**: Paint and splatter letters. Use watercolors, food coloring water, or washable paint instead of markers. Child paints their letter, splatters colors, or creates texture with brushes.

**Variation 3**: Letter to a character. Focus the letter on someone specific and imaginary—a storybook character, stuffed animal, or fantasy friend. Child creates a letter to them, drawing pictures of things that character likes.

**Repeat play**: Use thematic variations like holiday letters (seasonal colors), thank you notes (gratitude focus), birthday letters (celebratory), or nature mail (made from natural materials).

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't know what to "write" or what their marks should represent.

**Solution**: Reframe from "writing a letter" to "making a picture and marks for someone." Explain: "Your colorful marks ARE the letter—that's how you're telling them about your ideas." Accept any marks, scribbles, or drawings as valid. Comment on what you observe rather than asking "what is it?"

**Challenge**: Child tears paper, has difficulty holding writing tools, or gets frustrated with fine motor tasks.

**Solution**: Use thicker paper (cardstock) that's harder to tear. Provide chunky crayons instead of thin markers. Use hand-over-hand guidance if needed. Keep activity time shorter. Normalize accidents: "Sometimes paper tears—that's okay! We can keep going."

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or wants to move on after brief engagement.

**Solution**: Shorter activity time is perfectly fine—even 5 minutes of mark-making is successful. For those wanting more engagement, rotate through different materials (crayons, then stickers, then paint) to maintain interest. Accept that attention spans vary by age and temperament.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Deliver the letter**: Mail the letter to the intended recipient or deliver it in person. Receiving their letter makes children feel accomplished and connected.

2. **Create a letter collection**: Keep letters in a special folder or box by year or age. Over time, you'll see how their mark-making develops—a beautiful record of growth.

3. **Connect to daily life**: Point out when letters arrive in your mailbox. Talk about who sent them and what messages they carry. Discuss how mail carriers help people stay connected.
