# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Making a Picture Diary or Journal

## Activity Summary

Children create and maintain a simple picture diary to document their daily experiences, feelings, and observations. This activity develops fine motor skills, self-expression, memory recall, and early literacy while giving children a meaningful way to chronicle their lives. Through drawing, stickers, and simple words, each child creates a personal treasure that celebrates their unique perspective.

## Vocabulary

**Chronicle**: To record or write down events and moments as they happen. When you make a picture diary, you are chronicling your day by drawing what happened.

**Reflect**: To think about something carefully and consider how it makes you feel. When you look back at your journal pages, you reflect on happy memories and special moments.

**Memory**: Something you remember from the past—a picture in your mind. Your journal helps you hold onto memories by drawing them before you forget.

**Expression**: Showing your feelings, ideas, and personality through art, words, or actions. Your picture diary is a way to show your own unique expression without anyone telling you what to draw.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children create the cover and first pages of their own picture journal, then begin documenting a special moment from their day through drawing. They'll discover that journals are personal creations where there are no "right" or "wrong" pictures—only their own authentic memories and feelings. This activity honors each child's voice and creativity.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on creative project with memory documentation

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (can be repeated daily for ongoing engagement)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Small bound journal, sketchbook, or construction paper stapled into a booklet (8-12 pages)
- Crayons, colored pencils, or markers
- Tape or glue stick
- Optional stickers or cut-out images for decoration

**Optional**:
- Decorative materials (glitter, puffy paint, stickers, washi tape)
- Pre-cut images or magazines for collage
- Washable paint pens
- Date stamps or stickers
- Blank labels for titling entries

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (use recycled paper and supplies you already have)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all materials and arrange on a low table accessible to the child
2. Have damp wipes or a washable cloth nearby for cleanup
3. Choose a quiet, comfortable space where the child can focus without rushing
4. If making journals from scratch, assemble 8-10 pages by folding and stapling construction paper beforehand

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Introduce the idea: "This is YOUR special book where YOU can draw and remember. Every day, we can draw something you saw or did. There's no right or wrong way to draw—this is YOUR way." Invite the child to decorate the cover with their name and favorite colors or stickers. Ask: "What should we call your journal?" Let them decide.

2. **Exploration** (8-12 minutes):
   Say: "Let's make your first page together. Think about something special that happened today—something you saw, someone you played with, or something that made you happy." Give them time to think. Ask guiding questions: "What was the best part of your day?" "What did you play with?" "Who did you spend time with?" Encourage them to draw on the first page. Provide minimal direction—the goal is their authentic expression, not a "finished" picture. If they need prompting, offer: "I see you drew... can you tell me about it?"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   As they draw, sit with them and ask follow-up questions: "Tell me about your picture. What's happening here?" "How does this make you feel?" "What was your favorite part?" Point out specific details you notice: "I see you used lots of blue—that's beautiful!" Write or help them write one simple word or sentence describing their entry if they're interested (e.g., "Playing with blocks" or "Sunny day").

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   Celebrate the page: "You made a memory! Now we can look at this whenever you want to remember today." Store the journal in a special, accessible place. Say: "Tomorrow we'll make another page for your journal."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use simpler prompts: "What did you play with today?" rather than "What made you happy?"
- Keep to one page per session
- Use thick crayons or markers that are easier to grip
- Focus more on the process of coloring and mark-making than representational drawing
- Help them label their drawings with simple words (just one or two)
- Accept scribbles and abstract marks as valid expressions of memory

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce more complex prompts: "Who did you play with? How did they make you feel?"
- Encourage them to use multiple pages, creating short stories across pages
- Introduce simple writing or letter practice alongside drawings
- Guide them to add more detail to their pictures
- Ask them to read back their entries and add more descriptions
- Suggest they draw sequentially (first this happened, then that happened)

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Themed Journals**: Create journals focused on specific themes like "Things I Love," "My Favorite Foods," "My Family," or "Places We Go." This helps children organize their thoughts and build vocabulary around themes.

**Variation 2 - Collaborative Family Journal**: Invite other family members to add to the journal too—parents can write captions, siblings can draw, grandparents can add memories. This turns it into a family keepsake and shows children that memories are shared experiences.

**Repeat Play - Seasonal Journals**: Start a new journal each season, comparing what changed from the last journal. In fall, draw leaves and sweaters; in spring, draw flowers and rain. This develops observation skills and understanding of time passing.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child draws the same thing repeatedly or says "I don't know what to draw."

**Solution**: Offer specific prompts tied to their immediate experience. Instead of "Draw something from today," try: "What did you eat for breakfast?" "Who did you see?" "What was the weather like?" You can also look through previous journal pages together and ask: "What would you like to add to that story?" Some children thrive with constraints—offer choices: "Do you want to draw our dog or our house today?"

**Challenge**: Child loses interest after the first few pages or journal feels like a chore.

**Solution**: Don't force daily entries. Let the journal be organic—sometimes a child might make 3 pages in one day because they're excited, then skip a few days. Honor their natural rhythm. Mix up the format: sometimes it's drawing, sometimes stickers, sometimes a photo glued in. Let them choose whether to participate each day. A journal maintained by enjoyment will be sustained longer than one made from obligation.

**Challenge**: Adult pressure to make it "look nice" or criticism from child about their own drawing.

**Solution**: Model acceptance: "I love how YOU drew that. It's perfect because it's from your imagination." Never offer suggestions to "improve" the drawing or correct their technique. Your role is to document and celebrate their authentic expression, not teach art skills. Children are incredibly perceptive about adult judgment—your genuine enthusiasm for their work is the single most important ingredient.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Looking Back**: Once a month, sit together and flip through the journal. Ask: "What do you remember about this picture? How were you feeling that day? What was different then compared to now?" This builds reflection and time awareness.

2. **Sharing Circle**: If in a group setting (childcare, preschool, library), create time for children to share their journal entries with peers. This validates their work and teaches communication skills.

3. **Creating a Display**: Hang a few journal pages on a low bulletin board or ribbon so children can see their work displayed. This builds confidence and shows that their memories matter enough to be seen by others.
