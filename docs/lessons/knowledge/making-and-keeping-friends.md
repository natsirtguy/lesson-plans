# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Making and Keeping Friends

## Activity Summary

Children explore the fundamentals of friendship through playful interaction, learning how to approach peers, take turns, share, and express care for others. Through hands-on activities and guided play, children discover that friendships begin with kindness, grow through shared experiences, and thrive when we listen and cooperate with one another.

## Vocabulary

**Companionship**: The friendly relationship you share when you spend time together with someone you like and enjoy. When you and another child play with blocks together all morning, you experience companionship.

**Cooperation**: Working together with another person toward a common goal, taking turns, and supporting each other. When two children build a block tower together, each adding pieces and helping each other balance them, they are practicing cooperation.

**Empathy**: The ability to understand how another person is feeling and care about their feelings, even when they're different from yours. When your friend drops their snack and looks sad, feeling sad with them and wanting to help shows empathy.

**Connection**: A special feeling of closeness and trust that grows between two people who spend time together and care about each other. The connection between friends makes them want to be together and help each other.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will create a "Friendship Memory Garden" by planting flower seeds together, decorating pots, and making friendship bookmarks. As they work, they'll practice the skills of cooperation, taking turns, and supporting a peer's creative efforts. They'll learn that friendships, like gardens, need care and attention to grow beautifully.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on cooperative craft and sensory exploration

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Small terracotta or plastic pots (one per child, or shared if working in pairs)
- Potting soil or garden soil
- Easy-to-grow seeds (sunflower, bean, or marigold seeds)
- Water in a spray bottle or small cup
- Markers, crayons, or paint pens
- Stickers with smiling faces, hearts, or flowers

**Optional**:
- Colorful tape for decorating pots
- Googly eyes to create character pots
- Small stones or pebbles for decorating
- Cardstock or cardboard for friendship bookmarks
- Hole punch and yarn for bookmarks
- Child-safe scissors

**Cost**: Free to $5 (most materials are common household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Set up a low table or workspace where 2-3 children can gather comfortably
2. Pour potting soil into a large bowl or container with a scoop
3. Place seeds in a small dish, and water in an accessible sprayer
4. Arrange markers and stickers in the center for easy sharing
5. Check that all materials are age-safe and non-toxic

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Sit together and explain: "Today, we're going to grow a friendship garden together. Just like we plant seeds and help them grow, we can plant friendship by helping each other and being kind. We'll each decorate a pot, plant a seed together, and make something special to remember our friendship."

   Show the children a seed and pass it around so they can touch it. Ask: "What will happen to this tiny seed? How can we help it grow?" Listen to their ideas and affirm that seeds need soil, water, and care—just like friendships need our attention and kindness.

2. **Exploration** (8-12 min):
   - **Decorating**: Give each child a pot and materials (markers, stickers, tape). Invite them to decorate their pot however they'd like. Encourage them to help each other: "Can you help your friend choose a sticker?" or "Let's take turns with the pink marker."

   - **Planting Together**: Once pots are decorated, children work in pairs or small groups. Have them take turns:
     - Scooping soil into the pot (one child scoops, the other steadies the pot)
     - Making a small hole with their finger
     - Placing the seed gently in the hole (they can do this together)
     - Covering with soil (sharing the scooping and patting)
     - Watering gently (taking turns with the spray bottle)

   - **Friendship Bookmarks** (optional, if time permits):
     Children can decorate paper bookmarks with drawings, stickers, or the words "My Friend [Friend's Name]." Punch a hole and tie with yarn.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Ask guiding questions as they work:
   - "How did it feel when your friend helped you plant the seed?"
   - "What will we need to do to help our garden grow?"
   - "How is taking care of a plant like being a good friend?"
   - "What happens if we forget to water our plant? What happens if we don't pay attention to our friends?"

   Point out cooperation as you observe it: "I noticed you both were so kind to each other when you took turns with the marker. That's real friendship!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Gather children together to admire their finished pots. Celebrate their cooperation: "You all worked together so beautifully! You helped each other, you took turns, and you were kind. That's exactly what friends do."

   Place the pots in a sunny windowsill where children can watch them grow over the coming weeks. Say: "Every time we water our plants, we can remember to show love to our friends too."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Simplify by having one adult-led pot for the whole group, or having children place pre-filled pots in soil rather than filling themselves
- Use chunky seeds (sunflower or bean) that are easier to handle
- Skip the bookmark-making component; focus on the planting experience
- Use only one or two decoration options (stickers OR markers, not all at once)
- Provide constant gentle guidance and modeling of turn-taking and sharing
- Keep explanations very concrete and simple: "We're planting a seed. It will grow into a flower. Water helps it grow. Your friend helps you."

**3-4+ years**:
- Children can scoop their own soil and fill pots more independently
- Introduce the idea of responsibility: "This is your plant. You'll help water it every few days. You'll watch it grow."
- Add the bookmark-making component and encourage writing their friend's name with support
- Ask more complex questions: "Why is cooperation important? What does it mean to be a good friend?"
- Challenge them to help a younger child or friend with their pot
- Suggest they draw or write predictions: "What do you think will happen to our seed?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Friendship Tree**: Instead of individual pots, plant a small tree or larger plant together as a "group friendship tree." Children can all help water it, and it becomes a living symbol of the friendships in your group.

**Variation 2 - Friend Scavenger Hunt**: After planting, go on a hunt around your space to find special items to place near the plants (smooth stone, pretty leaf, colorful pebble). Encourage children to find things together and work as a team.

**Repeat Play**: Check on the plants daily. As they grow, talk about the friendship connections: "Look! Our seeds are sprouting, just like our friendships are growing. We've been taking care of them with water and sunshine, and we've been taking care of each other with kindness and listening."

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: A child wants to plant alone or refuses to share materials and take turns.

**Solution**: This is developmentally normal, especially for children 2-3 years old. Acknowledge the feeling: "I see you want the markers. Your friend is using them right now. Let's take turns—you can use them after." You might set a timer or have two sets of popular items. Praise generously when they do share, even briefly. Remember that turn-taking is a skill that develops over time.

**Challenge**: Conflicts arise over materials or children become frustrated during the activity.

**Solution**: Keep the activity short and manageable. Have extra supplies if possible (two pots, two scoops, two marker sets). When conflict starts, pause and problem-solve together: "You both want the watering can. What could we do?" Validate emotions: "I see you're frustrated. That's okay. Let's try together." Model cooperation yourself by asking children to help you with tasks.

**Challenge**: A shy child hesitates to interact with peers during the activity.

**Solution**: Don't force interaction. Allow the shy child to work alongside others at first, observing. Pair them with a calm, friendly peer or an adult. Start with very small interactions: "Can you hand your friend a sticker?" Once they're comfortable, gradually encourage more direct interaction. Shy friendships often start this way—quiet, observational, and just as meaningful.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Plant Care**: Make watering the plant part of your daily routine. Invite different children to water together, creating regular one-on-one or small-group friendship moments.

2. **Friendship Circle Time**: Once a week, gather to talk about friendships. Ask: "Who did you play with today? What did you do together? How did that make you feel?" Read books about friendship like "Will You Be My Friend?" by Nancy Carlson or "The Rainbow Fish" by Marcus Pfister.

3. **Extend Beyond the Plant**: Notice and celebrate friendship moments throughout the day: "You shared your snack with your friend. That's what friends do!" Help children understand that friendship isn't just a special activity—it's how they treat each other every day during play, meals, and transitions.
