# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Making Good Decisions

## Activity Summary

Children learn that decisions are choices we make every day, and that thinking about consequences helps us make good ones. Through interactive scenarios, sorting activities, and guided practice, the child discovers how to pause, consider options, and choose actions that are helpful and safe.

## Vocabulary

**Consequence**: What happens as a result of a choice or action. If you choose to run in the grass, the consequence might be getting tired. If you choose to be gentle with a toy, the consequence is the toy stays nice.

**Option**: A choice you can pick from several possibilities. At snack time, you might have the option to eat an apple or a banana.

**Decision**: Making a choice between two or more things. When you decide whether to play with blocks or paint, you are making a decision.

**Safe**: Free from harm or danger. Holding hands when crossing the street is safe. Playing too rough with the dog is not safe.

## Hands-On Knowledge Activity

### Activity Overview

Children engage in "Choice Scenarios" where they practice making decisions through real-life situations presented with props or pictures. They sort scenarios into "good choice" and "needs practice" categories, then role-play making better decisions. This concrete exploration helps children understand that decisions have outcomes, and that pausing to think leads to better choices.

**Activity Type**: Sorting activity with role-play and guided decision-making practice

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards or simple drawings showing decision scenarios (see preparation below)
- Two sorting bins, baskets, or circles labeled "Good Choice" and "Needs Practice"
- Props for role-play (stuffed animals, blocks, toy food, dress-up items)
- Chart paper or whiteboard to draw simple choice diagrams

**Optional**:
- Puppet or stuffed animal "helper" to demonstrate choices
- Sound effects (bell for "thinking time," cheerful tone for good choices)
- Sticker chart for positive reinforcement
- Mirror to help child see themselves making expressions of thinking/deciding

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (use household items and paper)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Create 8-10 simple scenario cards with drawings or pictures showing common childhood decisions:
   - Sharing a toy vs. refusing to share
   - Using words vs. hitting when frustrated
   - Asking permission vs. taking something
   - Playing gently vs. rough play with a pet
   - Listening vs. ignoring when asked to come
   - Trying something new vs. refusing to try
   - Helping a friend vs. ignoring them
   - Sitting safely in car seat vs. unbuckling
2. Set up two labeled bins or draw two circles on the floor
3. Test that the scenario cards are age-appropriate and clear
4. Have role-play props easily accessible

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Say: "Today we're learning about decisions—that means making choices. Every day, we make lots of decisions. Some decisions are really good ones, and some need practice. Let's explore together!"
   Show a simple scenario (e.g., "Here's a choice: Someone has a toy you want. What do you do?").
   Use an excited, conversational tone. Validate that decisions can be tricky.

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   Introduce the sorting activity: "I have some choice cards. For each one, we'll decide: Is this a good choice, or does it need practice?"
   Show the first card slowly. Ask: "What's happening in this picture?"
   Guide the child to think: "What happens when we make this choice? Is it safe? Is it kind?"
   Place the card in the appropriate bin together.
   Continue with 5-7 more scenarios, letting the child do most of the sorting with your guidance.
   Celebrate good choices: "That's a good choice! It keeps everyone safe and happy."
   For "needs practice" choices, be gentle: "This one needs practice. Let's think about a better way."

3. **Discovery** (4-5 min):
   Pick one "needs practice" scenario and role-play a better choice.
   Use props or stuffed animals: "Let's pretend we're friends who both want the same toy. What's a good decision?"
   Guide the child to suggest or act out solutions (sharing, taking turns, playing together, asking for help).
   Repeat with 1-2 more scenarios if time allows.
   Ask reflection questions: "What made that a good choice? Who felt happy?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Summarize: "You just learned about making good decisions! When you have a choice, you can stop and think: Is it safe? Is it kind? Will it make people happy?"
   Give specific praise: "You made great choices today about [specific scenario]. That shows you're thinking!"
   Offer a bridge: "This week, notice all the big and small decisions you make. You're a great decision-maker!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use 4-5 simple scenarios instead of 8-10; focus on very concrete choices (safe/not safe, gentle/not gentle)
- Keep role-play very brief and fun rather than problem-solving focused
- Use puppets or stuffed animals to model choices (less pressure on child)
- Use single words or very short phrases: "Safe choice!" or "Uh-oh, not safe"
- Celebrate participation and any thinking attempt, not just correct answers
- May need significant adult guidance in sorting; focus on the fun of trying

**3-4+ years**:
- Include 7-10 scenarios with more nuance (e.g., "telling the truth vs. being scared to tell the truth")
- Extend role-play to full problem-solving: "What else could we do?" and "Why is that a good choice?"
- Introduce a simple decision-making chart: "When I make a choice, I think: Is it safe? Is it kind? Am I being a good friend?"
- Ask: "What do you think will happen if we make this choice?" (consequences)
- Challenge: "Can you think of another good choice for this problem?"
- Encourage independent sorting with minimal prompts

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Decision Stories**: Read simple picture books about characters making choices (e.g., "The Color Monster," "In My Heart," "The Feelings Book"). Stop and ask: "What choice does [character] make? Is that a good choice? What else could they do?"

**Variation 2 - Family Decisions**: Play "Decision Detective" at home. During the week, notice and comment on real family decisions: "You chose to use kind words when you were frustrated. That's a great decision!" or "Let's think together about the best way to do this."

**Variation 3 - Choice Board**: Create a simple visual chart showing common daily decisions (getting dressed, eating, playing, bedtime) with two options each. Use pictures or drawings. Regularly point to it and let your child make decisions from the board (you still supervise safety).

**Repeat play**: Change the scenarios every 2-3 days. Let your child suggest "choice cards" for things they're learning about. As confidence grows, extend from "good" and "not safe" to more nuanced decisions (being brave, trying new things, managing disappointment).

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child seems unable to recognize consequences or struggles to predict what might happen from a choice.
**Solution**: This is completely normal at ages 2-3; their brains are still developing cause-and-effect thinking. Use simple, immediate cause-and-effect language: "You threw the block. It hit the wall. Block is broken now." Don't expect abstract thinking. Focus on safe/not safe rather than complex consequences.

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated or defensive when scenarios show "bad choices" (especially if they feel criticized for making that choice).
**Solution**: Use a very gentle, playful tone. Frame as "Let's help this character" or "Let's think of a better way" rather than judgment. Never say "You did this wrong." Instead: "Sometimes we all make choices that need practice. Let's find a better way." Use puppets to role-play mistakes, which feels less personal to the child.

**Challenge**: Child keeps wanting to make the "silly" or "wrong" choice during role-play because it's funny.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal—children this age love humor and testing boundaries. Acknowledge the fun: "That IS funny!" and then gently redirect: "Now let's see what a good choice looks like. Can you help?" Make both versions fun, just with clear labels.

**Challenge**: Child is indecisive or wants you to make all the choices for them.
**Solution**: Offer small, safe choices throughout the day ("apple or banana?", "red shirt or blue shirt?"). This builds confidence in decision-making. Never force decisions; sometimes children need adult guidance. Say: "I notice this is tricky. Let's think together." Model thinking aloud: "Hmm, if I play rough with the puppy, the puppy might feel scared. So I'll be gentle instead."

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Decision Moments**: Throughout the day, pause and label decisions: "You chose to ask nicely for help. Great decision!" This real-time narration is more powerful than any activity.

2. **Problem-Solving Together**: When conflicts arise naturally (sibling disputes, wanting something unavailable), say: "We have a problem. What are some choices we could make?" Let the child suggest solutions. This is practicing decision-making in real life.

3. **Consequences Walk**: During a walk or around your home, notice results of choices together: "Look, the flowers are growing because someone watered them—that was a good choice!" or "This toy is broken because it was played with too roughly—a choice that needs practice next time."
