# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Making Good Decisions

## Activity Summary

Children learn that decisions are choices we make every day, and that thinking about consequences helps us make good ones. Through interactive scenarios, sorting activities, and guided practice, the child discovers how to pause, consider options, and choose actions that are helpful and safe.

## Vocabulary

**Trade-off**: When you choose one thing, you give up something else — that's a trade-off. If you choose to play with blocks, you trade off time you could spend painting. Every decision has a trade-off because you can't do everything at once.

**Consequence**: What happens as a result of a choice or action — the effect that follows a cause. If you choose to run in the grass, the consequence might be getting tired. If you choose to be gentle with a toy, the consequence is the toy stays nice. Every choice creates a chain of consequences.

**Prefrontal cortex**: The front part of your brain, right behind your forehead, that helps you think before you act. When you stop and think instead of grabbing a toy, your prefrontal cortex is working! In young children, this part of the brain is still growing, which is why pausing to think takes practice.

**Cost-benefit analysis**: Thinking about what you gain (the benefit) and what you lose (the cost) before making a choice. If you eat your dessert first, the benefit is sweetness now, but the cost might be a tummy ache. Real decision-makers — doctors, engineers, even astronauts — use cost-benefit analysis every day.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: If You're Happy and You Know It

**Tempo**: Thoughtful and encouraging

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
When you make a good decision, think it through
When you make a good decision, think it through
Look at every option here
Ask yourself, "Is this safe and clear?"
Every consequence will help you, yes it's true

*Verse 2*
When you have to make a choice, stop and think
When you have to make a choice, stop and think
Think of all your options now
Make decisions, here's how
Good decisions help us all stay safe and kind

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Place hand on chin in thinking pose on "think it through"
2. Count on fingers on "option" to show different choices available
3. Nod head yes on "safe and kind" to affirm good choices

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children engage in "Choice Scenarios" where they practice making decisions through real-life situations presented with props or pictures. They sort scenarios into "good choice" and "needs practice" categories, then role-play making better decisions. This concrete exploration helps children understand that decisions have outcomes, and that pausing to think leads to better choices.

**Activity Type**: Sorting activity with role-play and guided decision-making practice

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards or simple drawings showing decision scenarios (see preparation below)
- Two sorting bins, baskets, or circles labeled "Good Choice" and "Needs Practice"
- Props for role-play (stuffed animals, blocks, toy food, dress-up items)
- Chart paper or whiteboard to draw simple choice diagrams

**Optional**:
- Puppet or stuffed animal "helper" to demonstrate choices
- Sound effects (bell for "thinking time," cheerful tone for good choices)
- Sticker chart for positive reinforcement
- Mirror to help child see themselves making expressions of thinking/deciding

**Cost**: Free to under $5 (use household items and paper)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Create 8-10 simple scenario cards with drawings or pictures showing common childhood decisions:
   - Sharing a toy vs. refusing to share
   - Using words vs. hitting when frustrated
   - Asking permission vs. taking something
   - Playing gently vs. rough play with a pet
   - Listening vs. ignoring when asked to come
   - Trying something new vs. refusing to try
   - Helping a friend vs. ignoring them
   - Sitting safely in car seat vs. unbuckling
2. Set up two labeled bins or draw two circles on the floor
3. Test that the scenario cards are age-appropriate and clear
4. Have role-play props easily accessible

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Say: "Today we're learning about decisions — that means making choices. Your brain has a special part right here (touch forehead) called the prefrontal cortex that helps you think before you act. It's like your brain's decision-making headquarters! Let's practice using it."
   Show a simple scenario (e.g., "Here's a choice: You want a toy someone else has. What could you do?").
   Explain: "Every choice has a trade-off. If you grab the toy, the trade-off is your friend feels sad. If you wait, the trade-off is you don't get it right away — but you keep the friendship."

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   Introduce the sorting activity: "I have some choice cards. For each one, we'll do a cost-benefit analysis — that means we'll think about what you gain and what you lose."
   Show the first card slowly. Ask: "What's happening in this picture?"
   For each card, model cost-benefit thinking: "If we share, the benefit is both friends are happy. The cost is you use the toy less. If you don't share, the benefit is you keep the toy, but the cost is your friend feels left out. Which has more benefits?"
   Place the card in the appropriate bin together.
   Continue with 5-7 more scenarios. For each, ask: "What's the trade-off? What's the consequence?"
   Reinforce: "Your prefrontal cortex is working hard right now — you're thinking before acting!"

3. **Discovery** (4-5 min):
   Pick one "needs practice" scenario and role-play different choices.
   Use props or stuffed animals: "Let's pretend we're friends who both want the same toy. Let's think of three different options and do a cost-benefit analysis for each one."
   Guide the child to compare solutions: sharing, taking turns, playing together, or finding a different toy. Ask: "Which option has the most benefits and the fewest costs?"
   Introduce the idea that sometimes the best decision isn't obvious: "Sometimes two choices both have good parts and hard parts. That's a real trade-off, and it's okay to take time to think."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Summarize: "You practiced using your prefrontal cortex today! When you have a choice, you can do a cost-benefit analysis: What do I gain? What's the trade-off? What are the consequences?"
   Touch forehead together: "Your prefrontal cortex is still growing — every time you stop and think, you're making it stronger."
   Give specific praise: "You thought about trade-offs today — that's what scientists and leaders do when they make important decisions!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use 4-5 simple scenarios with very concrete choices (safe/not safe, gentle/not gentle)
- Keep role-play brief; use puppets to model choices (less pressure on child)
- Simplify cost-benefit to two parts: "If you do this, what happens?" (consequence) and "Is that what you want?" (evaluation)
- Touch forehead to introduce prefrontal cortex: "Your thinking brain is right here!"
- Still use the real terms — say "trade-off" and "consequence" even if the child won't fully grasp them; the exposure matters
- May need significant adult guidance; celebrate any thinking attempt

**3-4+ years**:
- Include 7-10 scenarios with more nuance (e.g., "telling the truth vs. being scared to tell the truth")
- Introduce explicit cost-benefit charts: draw a simple T-chart with "Benefits" on one side and "Costs" on the other
- Discuss that the prefrontal cortex is the last part of the brain to fully develop — "Even grown-ups are still learning to use theirs!"
- Introduce **opportunity cost**: "When you chose to play blocks, the opportunity cost was painting. You can't do both at the same time."
- Ask: "Can you think of a decision where both choices have good trade-offs?" (genuine dilemmas, not just right/wrong)
- Challenge: "What would a scientist do? They'd gather information before deciding — let's try that!"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Decision Stories**: Read simple picture books about characters making choices (e.g., "The Color Monster," "In My Heart," "The Feelings Book"). Stop and ask: "What choice does [character] make? Is that a good choice? What else could they do?"

**Variation 2 - Family Decisions**: Play "Decision Detective" at home. During the week, notice and comment on real family decisions: "You chose to use kind words when you were frustrated. That's a great decision!" or "Let's think together about the best way to do this."

**Variation 3 - Choice Board**: Create a simple visual chart showing common daily decisions (getting dressed, eating, playing, bedtime) with two options each. Use pictures or drawings. Regularly point to it and let your child make decisions from the board (you still supervise safety).

**Repeat play**: Change the scenarios every 2-3 days. Let your child suggest "choice cards" for things they're learning about. As confidence grows, extend from "good" and "not safe" to more nuanced decisions (being brave, trying new things, managing disappointment).

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child seems unable to recognize consequences or struggles to predict what might happen from a choice.
**Solution**: This is completely normal at ages 2-3; their brains are still developing cause-and-effect thinking. Use simple, immediate cause-and-effect language: "You threw the block. It hit the wall. Block is broken now." Don't expect abstract thinking. Focus on safe/not safe rather than complex consequences.

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated or defensive when scenarios show "bad choices" (especially if they feel criticized for making that choice).
**Solution**: Use a very gentle, playful tone. Frame as "Let's help this character" or "Let's think of a better way" rather than judgment. Never say "You did this wrong." Instead: "Sometimes we all make choices that need practice. Let's find a better way." Use puppets to role-play mistakes, which feels less personal to the child.

**Challenge**: Child keeps wanting to make the "silly" or "wrong" choice during role-play because it's funny.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal—children this age love humor and testing boundaries. Acknowledge the fun: "That IS funny!" and then gently redirect: "Now let's see what a good choice looks like. Can you help?" Make both versions fun, just with clear labels.

**Challenge**: Child is indecisive or wants you to make all the choices for them.
**Solution**: Offer small, safe choices throughout the day ("apple or banana?", "red shirt or blue shirt?"). This builds confidence in decision-making. Never force decisions; sometimes children need adult guidance. Say: "I notice this is tricky. Let's think together." Model thinking aloud: "Hmm, if I play rough with the puppy, the puppy might feel scared. So I'll be gentle instead."

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Decision Moments**: Throughout the day, pause and label decisions: "You chose to ask nicely for help. Great decision!" This real-time narration is more powerful than any activity.

2. **Problem-Solving Together**: When conflicts arise naturally (sibling disputes, wanting something unavailable), say: "We have a problem. What are some choices we could make?" Let the child suggest solutions. This is practicing decision-making in real life.

3. **Consequences Walk**: During a walk or around your home, notice results of choices together: "Look, the flowers are growing because someone watered them—that was a good choice!" or "This toy is broken because it was played with too roughly—a choice that needs practice next time."
