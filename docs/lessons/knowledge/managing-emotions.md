# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Managing Emotions

## Activity Summary

Children will learn to recognize and name their emotions through interactive activities, songs, and guided exploration. This lesson teaches young learners that all feelings are normal and provides simple strategies to manage big emotions in healthy ways.

## Vocabulary

Select 3-4 vocabulary words that are sophisticated but age-appropriate and directly relate to the topic.

**Amygdala**: A small, almond-shaped part deep inside your brain that acts as your alarm system. When you feel scared, angry, or threatened, your amygdala fires off a signal before you even think about it — that's why big emotions feel so fast and powerful. The amygdala is doing its job: keeping you safe by reacting quickly.

**Fight-or-flight response**: When your amygdala detects danger (or something that feels like danger), it triggers your body's fight-or-flight response: your heart beats faster, you breathe quickly, your muscles tense up, and your body releases a chemical called cortisol. This response evolved to help humans escape predators — but it also activates when you're upset about a toy or frustrated with a friend.

**Regulate**: To manage your emotions by activating the calmer part of your nervous system — the parasympathetic nervous system. When you take slow, deep breaths, you send a signal from your lungs through a nerve called the vagus nerve to your brain, telling it: "We're safe. Slow down." That's why deep breathing actually works — it's not just a trick, it's real neuroscience.

**Cortisol**: A stress chemical (hormone) your body releases during the fight-or-flight response. Cortisol makes your heart pound and your muscles tighten. When you calm down — by breathing, hugging, or feeling safe — your cortisol levels drop and your body relaxes. Too much cortisol for too long isn't good for your body, which is why learning to regulate is important.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Gentle and reassuring

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
I can identify my feelings
All my emotions today
Happy, sad, and mad and calm
I can name them, that's okay
With an emotion here
And an emotion there
Here a feeling, there a feeling
Everywhere an emotion
I can identify my feelings
Name them every day

*Verse 2*
I can regulate when I'm upset
Finding ways to be calm
Take deep breaths and hug my bear
Safe and peaceful in my arms
With a breath, breath here
And a breath, breath there
Here a breath, there a breath
Everywhere a calm breath
I can regulate my feelings
Being calm today

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point to different parts of body on "identify" to show where emotions are felt
2. Take deep breaths with arms rising and falling on "regulate" and "calm"
3. Hug self or a stuffed animal on "hug my bear" to show self-soothing

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will create an "Emotion Faces" exploration using craft materials, mirrors, and sensory items. They'll practice identifying different emotions by making facial expressions, matching feelings to situations, and creating a personalized emotion wheel or chart to recognize their own feelings.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration and hands-on demonstration

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper plates or cardstock circles
- Markers (various colors)
- Mirror (handheld or child-safe)
- Cotton balls or pom-poms (for hair/texture)
- Googly eyes (optional)
- Glue stick or tape

**Optional**:
- Craft foam pieces
- Colored paper for cutting
- Feathers or yarn for variety
- Pictures of emotional faces (from magazines or printed)
- Emotion cards with words and illustrations

**Cost**: Free (most households have these supplies) or under $5 if purchasing craft items

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all craft materials and arrange in small bowls or containers within easy reach
2. Ensure mirrors are clean, safe, and positioned where children can see themselves
3. Set up a designated workspace with a washable tablecloth or mat to contain materials
4. Prepare emotion cards or reference pictures if using them

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Point to the middle of the child's forehead: "Inside your brain, there's a tiny part called the amygdala — it's shaped like an almond. Your amygdala is like an alarm system. When something scary or upsetting happens, your amygdala fires FAST — before you even think about it."
   Show emotion faces — happy, sad, angry, scared — using mirror: "When your amygdala fires, it triggers something called the fight-or-flight response. Your heart beats faster (put hand on chest), you breathe quickly, and your body makes a chemical called cortisol that makes your muscles tense."
   "All these feelings are your brain doing its job. Let's learn about them AND learn how to calm the alarm down."

2. **Exploration** (8-12 minutes):
   Provide materials to create emotion faces on paper plates. As they create each face, connect to the neuroscience:
   - **Angry face**: "When you feel angry, your amygdala has sent the alarm signal. Cortisol is flooding your body. Your heart is pounding. That's the fight-or-flight response."
   - **Scared face**: "Fear is your amygdala's specialty — it evolved to detect danger and react FAST. Eyes go wide, muscles tense. Your body is getting ready to run."
   - **Happy face**: "When you feel happy, your brain releases different chemicals — dopamine and serotonin. These feel good and help you relax."
   - **Calm face**: "When you're calm, your parasympathetic nervous system is in charge. Your heartbeat slows, cortisol drops, and your body relaxes."
   Let them create freely while you weave in the science naturally.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   Practice the regulation mechanism: "Here's the amazing part — you can actually TURN DOWN the amygdala's alarm. Watch." Demonstrate slow, deep breathing.
   Explain: "When you breathe slowly, your lungs send a signal through a special nerve called the vagus nerve all the way to your brain. The vagus nerve tells your brain: 'We're safe. Turn off the alarm.' Your cortisol goes down, your heart slows, and you feel calmer."
   Practice together: breathe in for 3, hold for 2, out for 4. "That's not just calming down — that's activating your parasympathetic nervous system. You're using real neuroscience!"
   Discuss triggers: "What makes YOUR amygdala fire? Is it when someone takes your toy? When it's too loud?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   Display the emotion faces. "These faces show what happens in your brain. Every emotion is your amygdala and your nervous system doing their jobs. And now you know the secret: slow breathing activates the vagus nerve, which calms everything down."
   Practice three final deep breaths together: "In... hold... out... Your cortisol is dropping right now. Your parasympathetic nervous system is taking over. You're regulating."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep it simple but still use real words. Point to their chest when their heart is racing: "That's your amygdala sending the alarm. Cortisol is making your heart go fast." Practice the breathing technique as a physical game — no pressure to understand the science, but say "vagus nerve" and "amygdala" each time. The words become familiar through exposure. Use a mirror for emotion faces. Label emotions naturally: "You're crying — that's your amygdala telling your brain something is wrong." Keep activity to 10 minutes max.

**3-4+ years**:
Create detailed emotion faces with the brain science labeled. Draw a simple brain diagram showing where the amygdala is. Explain the full chain: "Scary thing happens → amygdala fires → cortisol releases → heart pounds → fight-or-flight." Then the calming chain: "Deep breath → vagus nerve activates → parasympathetic system turns on → cortisol drops → calm." Challenge them: "Can you feel your heartbeat speed up when you're angry? That's cortisol. Can you slow it down with breathing? That's the vagus nerve." Have them act out scenarios and practice regulation in real-time. Introduce dopamine: "When you feel proud of something you built, that good feeling is dopamine — your brain's reward chemical."

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Emotion Charades**: Use the emotion faces cards or drawings to play a simple game where one child makes the expression and others guess the feeling. This reinforces emotion recognition and vocabulary.

**Variation 2 - Emotion Freeze Dance**: Play music and have children dance freely. When the music stops, call out an emotion ("Show me your happy face!" or "Make an angry face!") and children freeze in that pose/expression. This combines movement with emotion identification.

**Repeat Play**: Create an Emotion Wheel by dividing a paper plate into sections and drawing different faces in each section. Use a spinner or point to different emotions throughout the day to discuss feelings. Add new emotions gradually (surprised, embarrassed, excited) as vocabulary builds.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child ignores emotion vocabulary and doesn't engage with naming feelings.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal for 2-year-olds. Focus on modeling language naturally during daily activities: "I see tears—you're sad" or "You're laughing—that means you're happy!" Emotions are abstract and take time to understand. Continue labeling throughout the day without pressure. Older children (3-4+) benefit from direct teaching, but younger toddlers learn through observation and gentle narration.

**Challenge**: Child gets upset when discussing or exploring sad/angry emotions, or seems to reject negative feelings.
**Solution**: Validate all emotions: "All feelings are okay. Sad feelings and angry feelings are normal and safe to have." Keep exploration light and brief. Don't force a child to engage with emotions that feel overwhelming. Return to this activity when the child is regulated and in a calm state. Use stuffed animals or books to explore feelings indirectly if direct engagement is too intense.

**Challenge**: Child acts out or becomes dysregulated during the activity instead of calm and engaged.
**Solution**: This may indicate the activity is overstimulating or the child needs a break. Simplify by focusing on just one or two emotions. Take a calming pause with deep breaths or quiet time. Try the activity at a different time of day when the child is better regulated. For some children, movement-based emotion exploration (Variation 2 - freeze dance) works better than sitting and creating.

### Follow-Up Activities
1. **Emotion Check-ins Throughout the Day**: Briefly ask "How are you feeling right now?" at natural transitions (before meals, after play, bedtime) to normalize emotion vocabulary and help the child develop emotional awareness.

2. **Emotion Books and Stories**: Read simple picture books about feelings ("The Feelings Book," "Today I Feel Silly," "The Color Monster") and discuss characters' emotions to reinforce concepts in a narrative context.

3. **Calming Strategies Practice**: Teach and practice simple regulation techniques when the child is calm: "breathe like a balloon," "squeeze play-dough," "count to five slowly," "hug your stuffy," or "go to our calm corner." Have these tools ready so when big emotions arise, you can offer them naturally.
