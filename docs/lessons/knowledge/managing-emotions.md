# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Managing Emotions

## Activity Summary

Children will learn to recognize and name their emotions through interactive activities, songs, and guided exploration. This lesson teaches young learners that all feelings are normal and provides simple strategies to manage big emotions in healthy ways.

## Vocabulary

Select 3-4 vocabulary words that are sophisticated but age-appropriate and directly relate to the topic.

**Emotion**: A feeling inside our body that tells us something about what we're experiencing. When you feel happy, sad, angry, or scared—those are all emotions. You can recognize your emotion by noticing how your body feels.

**Calm**: A peaceful, quiet feeling when your body is relaxed and your breathing is slow and easy. You feel calm when you're resting, listening to soft music, or sitting with someone you love.

**Identify**: To recognize and name something, like pointing out what color a toy is or saying "I feel angry" when you notice that feeling inside. When you identify your emotion, you're becoming a feelings detective!

**Regulate**: To manage or control your feelings and actions in a way that feels healthy and safe. When you take deep breaths or hug your stuffed animal when you're upset, you're regulating your emotions.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will create an "Emotion Faces" exploration using craft materials, mirrors, and sensory items. They'll practice identifying different emotions by making facial expressions, matching feelings to situations, and creating a personalized emotion wheel or chart to recognize their own feelings.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration and hands-on demonstration

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper plates or cardstock circles
- Markers (various colors)
- Mirror (handheld or child-safe)
- Cotton balls or pom-poms (for hair/texture)
- Googly eyes (optional)
- Glue stick or tape

**Optional**:
- Craft foam pieces
- Colored paper for cutting
- Feathers or yarn for variety
- Pictures of emotional faces (from magazines or printed)
- Emotion cards with words and illustrations

**Cost**: Free (most households have these supplies) or under $5 if purchasing craft items

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all craft materials and arrange in small bowls or containers within easy reach
2. Ensure mirrors are clean, safe, and positioned where children can see themselves
3. Set up a designated workspace with a washable tablecloth or mat to contain materials
4. Prepare emotion cards or reference pictures if using them

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Start by sitting together and asking, "What do your faces look like when you feel happy? Show me!" Demonstrate different emotions with exaggerated facial expressions—happy (big smile), sad (corners of mouth down), angry (eyebrows down), scared (eyes wide, mouth open). Use the mirror so children can see themselves making these expressions. Say: "We all have feelings, and our face shows what we're feeling!"

2. **Exploration** (8-12 minutes):
   Provide each child with a paper plate and basic materials to create emotion faces. They can draw eyes, nose, and mouth using markers to show different feelings. Encourage them to look in the mirror while creating—"Does your happy face look like this?" Allow children to add texture with cotton balls, pom-poms, or other materials to add personality. Some children may create one face, others may want to make several. This is exploratory, so let them lead. Ask open-ended questions: "What emotion are you making?" "How does that face feel?" "When do you feel that way?"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   Gather the emotion faces and examine them together. Hold up each creation and ask, "What feeling is this?" and "Can you make that face in the mirror?" Discuss situations that trigger emotions: "When do you feel happy?" "What makes you sad?" "When were you angry?" Help children connect their emotional experiences to specific situations. Point out that everyone feels all these emotions, and that's perfectly normal.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   Display the emotion faces in a visible spot where the child can see them daily. Explain: "These are all your feelings. When you notice a feeling inside, you can look at these faces and say the name of your feeling. Knowing your feelings helps you take care of yourself!" Transition with: "Now let's take three deep breaths together" (demonstrate slow, deep breathing) before moving to the next activity.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep it simple and sensory-focused. Provide pre-cut circles and let children place googly eyes and materials freely without pressure to create specific faces. Use a mirror and make exaggerated expressions together. Label emotions as they occur naturally throughout the day: "You're happy! You're smiling!" Keep activity to 10 minutes max. Focus on recognition rather than creation.

**3-4+ years**:
Encourage more detailed creation with markers, intentional feature placement, and adding details. Have them draw multiple faces showing different emotions. Use emotion cards to match their creation to vocabulary. Ask "why" questions: "Why do you think this face is angry?" Have them act out scenarios: "Show me your face when you're excited about a birthday!" Challenge them to create combination emotions: "Can you make a surprised-happy face?" Extend to discussing strategies for managing emotions.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Emotion Charades**: Use the emotion faces cards or drawings to play a simple game where one child makes the expression and others guess the feeling. This reinforces emotion recognition and vocabulary.

**Variation 2 - Emotion Freeze Dance**: Play music and have children dance freely. When the music stops, call out an emotion ("Show me your happy face!" or "Make an angry face!") and children freeze in that pose/expression. This combines movement with emotion identification.

**Repeat Play**: Create an Emotion Wheel by dividing a paper plate into sections and drawing different faces in each section. Use a spinner or point to different emotions throughout the day to discuss feelings. Add new emotions gradually (surprised, embarrassed, excited) as vocabulary builds.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child ignores emotion vocabulary and doesn't engage with naming feelings.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal for 2-year-olds. Focus on modeling language naturally during daily activities: "I see tears—you're sad" or "You're laughing—that means you're happy!" Emotions are abstract and take time to understand. Continue labeling throughout the day without pressure. Older children (3-4+) benefit from direct teaching, but younger toddlers learn through observation and gentle narration.

**Challenge**: Child gets upset when discussing or exploring sad/angry emotions, or seems to reject negative feelings.
**Solution**: Validate all emotions: "All feelings are okay. Sad feelings and angry feelings are normal and safe to have." Keep exploration light and brief. Don't force a child to engage with emotions that feel overwhelming. Return to this activity when the child is regulated and in a calm state. Use stuffed animals or books to explore feelings indirectly if direct engagement is too intense.

**Challenge**: Child acts out or becomes dysregulated during the activity instead of calm and engaged.
**Solution**: This may indicate the activity is overstimulating or the child needs a break. Simplify by focusing on just one or two emotions. Take a calming pause with deep breaths or quiet time. Try the activity at a different time of day when the child is better regulated. For some children, movement-based emotion exploration (Variation 2 - freeze dance) works better than sitting and creating.

### Follow-Up Activities
1. **Emotion Check-ins Throughout the Day**: Briefly ask "How are you feeling right now?" at natural transitions (before meals, after play, bedtime) to normalize emotion vocabulary and help the child develop emotional awareness.

2. **Emotion Books and Stories**: Read simple picture books about feelings ("The Feelings Book," "Today I Feel Silly," "The Color Monster") and discuss characters' emotions to reinforce concepts in a narrative context.

3. **Calming Strategies Practice**: Teach and practice simple regulation techniques when the child is calm: "breathe like a balloon," "squeeze play-dough," "count to five slowly," "hug your stuffy," or "go to our calm corner." Have these tools ready so when big emotions arise, you can offer them naturally.
