# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Maps and Directions

## Activity Summary

Children explore how maps help us understand spaces and find our way, learning that maps are bird's-eye views of real places. Through hands-on activities with simple maps and navigation, children develop spatial awareness and begin understanding how symbols represent real things in their environment.

## Vocabulary

Select 3-4 vocabulary words that:
- Are sophisticated but age-appropriate
- Are adult words that expand beyond toddler basics
- Directly relate to the topic
- Can be demonstrated or experienced

**Navigate**: To find your way from one place to another by following directions or a map. When you navigate to the playground, you follow the path that leads there.

**Symbol**: A simple picture or mark that stands for something real. On a map, a little tree symbol represents an actual tree you can see outside.

**Landmark**: An important or easy-to-recognize place that helps you know where you are. Your house, the playground, or the big red mailbox are landmarks you see in your neighborhood.

**Route**: The path or way you take to get from one place to another. Your route to the park might go down the sidewalk, across the street, then through the gate.

## Hands-On Knowledge Activity

### Activity Overview

Children create and use their own simple map of a familiar space, learning how to represent real objects with symbols and follow a path from one location to another. By making and using a map they've created, children develop spatial reasoning and understand that maps are tools for navigation.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on demonstration with creative map-making and navigation play

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Large paper or poster board (11x14 inches minimum)
- Colored markers or crayons
- Small objects to place on a real floor or table (toy house, toy tree, small block for mailbox)
- Open floor space or large table (at least 4x4 feet)

**Optional**:
- Stickers (trees, houses, people)
- Construction paper to cut shapes
- String or yarn to show routes/paths
- Small toy figures or counting bears

**Cost**: Free (using household items) or Under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Arrange small objects on the floor in a simple layout (e.g., toy house in one corner, toy tree in another, block as mailbox)
2. Have paper and markers ready for map-making
3. Clear a safe space for walking along drawn or imagined paths

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Start by asking the child to look at the small space you've arranged. Say: "We're going to make a map of this space - maps are like pictures from the sky looking down. Let's pretend we're birds flying high up and looking down at all these things." Point to each object and name it. Let the child touch each object so they understand what's real.

2. **Exploration** (5-8 min):
   Guide the child to draw the space on paper as if looking from above. Start by drawing a simple rectangle for the space edge. Then ask: "Where is the house? Let's put a small drawing here." Draw together or let the child draw with your support. Add symbols for each object (a small square for house, circle for tree, line for mailbox). Use different colors for each symbol. Don't worry about artistic accuracy - the goal is understanding that the map represents real things.

3. **Discovery** (5-7 min):
   Once the map is complete, point to it and say: "This map shows our space from up high, like a bird sees it." Point to one symbol, then find the real object: "Here's the tree on the map - do you see the real tree?" Repeat with other symbols. Then ask: "What's the path from the house to the tree? Let's trace it with our finger on the map." Trace a route together. Then walk that route in the real space. Ask: "Did we follow the same path?" Use words like "north," "south," "left," and "right" as you trace: "We go right to the tree, then left to the mailbox."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Celebrate the map together. Ask: "What did we learn? Maps help us see places from up high. Symbols on the map show real things. We can follow paths on maps to know where to go." Ask the child to place a new toy object in the space and draw its symbol on the map, then navigate to it. End by saying: "You're a great navigator!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep the space very small with only 2-3 objects. Draw the map for them and let them color it. Focus on touching real objects, then finding them on the map. Use simple one-word directions: "up," "down," "left," "right." Let them place stickers on the map rather than draw.

**3-4+ years**:
Have them draw more of the map with your guidance. Include 4-5 objects and discuss more complex paths. Use full direction words: "We go north to the tree, then east to the house." Introduce simple grid concepts by drawing light lines. Challenge them to create a second map and compare, or to place new objects and update the map.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Neighborhood Walk Map**: Take a photo or draw a simple map of your actual neighborhood (house, mailbox, nearby park, street). Discuss how maps of real places help us not get lost. Walk the route together.

**Variation 2 - Treasure Map**: Hide a small toy or treat in the room. Create a map showing where it is using symbols and a marked path. Let the child use the map to find the treasure. Switch roles - have them hide something and you use their map.

**Repeat Play**: Change the objects in your space each time, redraw the map, and navigate to different locations. Or draw maps of other familiar spaces (bedroom, living room, kitchen) and practice navigating within them. Create maps together of places you visit (grandparent's house, library).

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child draws the map from a front view instead of from above (bird's-eye view).

**Solution**: This is developmentally normal! Use the language "pretend we're a bird flying high up" and physically look down at the space from above before drawing. You might demonstrate by holding a toy bird high above the space and describing what you see from that angle. Expect this to take several exposures before children shift perspective.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand that the symbol "stands for" the real object.

**Solution**: Make the connection explicit and repeatedly. Point to the symbol on the map and say the word ("tree"), then walk to the real tree and touch it saying "real tree." Do this connection 3-4 times. Use very clear, iconic symbols (a circle with scribbles for a tree looks like a tree; a square looks like a house).

**Challenge**: Child wants to navigate by running rather than following the map route.

**Solution**: This is normal! Let them run, but remind them to "look at the map first" and "follow the path on the map." Use the map as the guide even if they're moving quickly. You might say: "The map says go left, so let's run left!"

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Map Real Spaces**: Draw simple maps of your home, yard, or neighborhood. Post them where your child can see and refer to them during daily routines. Point to the map when going to different rooms.

2. **Hunt the Landmark**: Play a game where you describe a landmark ("Can you find the big red mailbox?") and navigate to it together, then discuss what you'd do on a map to show where to find it.

3. **Create a Class or Family Map**: If in a group setting, work together to create a large map of your learning space. Take photos of areas and add them to the map. Update it seasonally or when you rearrange.
