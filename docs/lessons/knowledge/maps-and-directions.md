# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Maps and Directions

## Activity Summary

Children explore how maps help us understand spaces and find our way, learning that maps are bird's-eye views of real places. Through hands-on activities with simple maps and navigation, children develop spatial awareness and begin understanding how symbols represent real things in their environment.

## Vocabulary

**Navigate**: To find your way from one place to another using directions, landmarks, or a map. Sailors navigated by stars for thousands of years before paper maps existed; today GPS satellites navigate for us — but the underlying system (coordinates) is the same.

**Bird's-Eye View / Aerial Perspective**: Looking at a space from directly above, as if you were a bird or airplane. This is the perspective all maps use. It requires a mental rotation of our normal experience — a table seen from above looks like a rectangle, not a table. This perspective shift is one of the cognitive skills maps teach.

**Map Scale**: The relationship between distance on the map and distance in the real world. A map where 1 inch = 1 mile lets you measure distances accurately. Without a scale, a map can't tell you how far things actually are.

**Legend / Map Key**: The section of a map that explains what each symbol means. A blue wavy line might mean a river; a green area might mean a park. Without the legend, symbols are unreadable.

**Cardinal Directions**: North, South, East, West — the four primary directions based on Earth's geography. North points toward the North Pole (magnetic north, where compass needles point, is slightly different from true north — but they're close). The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, which is why ancient people could always orient themselves.

**Coordinate System**: A grid system for pinpointing any location on Earth using two numbers: latitude (distance north or south of the equator, 0°–90°) and longitude (distance east or west of the prime meridian, 0°–180°). GPS satellites use this same system — your phone knows where you are because multiple satellites triangulate your exact coordinates.

**Symbol**: A simple picture or mark that represents something real. On a map, a blue line represents a river; a triangle represents a mountain peak. Maps work because both the map-maker and map-reader agree on what symbols mean — this is a form of written language.

**Route**: The specific path taken from one place to another. Multiple routes can connect the same two points — the "best" route depends on your priorities (fastest, most scenic, avoiding traffic, etc.).

## Learning Song

**Tune**: The Itsy Bitsy Spider

**Tempo**: Moderate and cheerful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
We navigate with our map,
Following the symbols here,
Landmarks help us find our way,
When the route is very clear
We look for trees and houses too,
Symbols show us where to go,
Following the map we made,
Learning as we go

*Verse 2*
The route goes up and down and round,
Navigate from here to there,
Symbols mark the special spots,
Landmarks everywhere
Maps help us to find our way,
Through the streets we walk each day,
Following the path we see,
Never go astray

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Trace a winding path in the air with your finger as you navigate
2. Point to different landmarks around the room
3. Make a square shape with hands to represent a map

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children create and use their own simple map of a familiar space, learning how to represent real objects with symbols and follow a path from one location to another. By making and using a map they've created, children develop spatial reasoning and understand that maps are tools for navigation.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on demonstration with creative map-making and navigation play

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Large paper or poster board (11x14 inches minimum)
- Colored markers or crayons
- Small objects to place on a real floor or table (toy house, toy tree, small block for mailbox)
- Open floor space or large table (at least 4x4 feet)

**Optional**:
- Stickers (trees, houses, people)
- Construction paper to cut shapes
- String or yarn to show routes/paths
- Small toy figures or counting bears

**Cost**: Free (using household items) or Under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Arrange small objects on the floor in a simple layout (e.g., toy house in one corner, toy tree in another, block as mailbox)
2. Have paper and markers ready for map-making
3. Clear a safe space for walking along drawn or imagined paths

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Start by asking the child to look at the small space you've arranged. Say: "We're going to make a map of this space - maps are like pictures from the sky looking down. Let's pretend we're birds flying high up and looking down at all these things." Point to each object and name it. Let the child touch each object so they understand what's real.

2. **Exploration** (5-8 min):
   Guide the child to draw the space on paper as if looking from above. Start by drawing a simple rectangle for the space edge. Then ask: "Where is the house? Let's put a small drawing here." Draw together or let the child draw with your support. Add symbols for each object (a small square for house, circle for tree, line for mailbox). Use different colors for each symbol. Don't worry about artistic accuracy - the goal is understanding that the map represents real things.

3. **Discovery** (5-7 min):
   Once the map is complete, point to it and say: "This map shows our space from up high — aerial perspective, like a bird's eye view." Point to one symbol, then find the real object: "Here's the tree on the map - do you see the real tree?" Make the legend explicit: "Let's make a legend — a key that explains our symbols." Draw a small box in the corner of the map labeled "Legend" and add each symbol with its meaning.

   Then trace a route: "What's the path from the house to the tree? Let's trace it with our finger on the map, then walk it in the real space." Use cardinal directions: "We go north to the tree, then east to the mailbox." Orient yourself: "North is toward that window because the sun comes in from the east in the morning, and north is to the left of east." This connects cardinal directions to real-world orientation.

4. **Scale moment** (2-3 min):
   "On our map, the house and tree are 3 inches apart. In real life, how far apart are they?" Measure in real life (steps, or ruler). "That's map scale — the ratio between the map and reality. On a road map, 1 inch might equal 50 miles. Your phone GPS uses the same idea but with satellites measuring your exact coordinates — your latitude and longitude." Show a phone or printed map with a scale bar if available.

5. **Wrap-up** (2 min):
   "What is a map?" (A bird's-eye view of a real space.) "What does the legend do?" (Explains symbols.) "Why do maps need a scale?" (So you know real distances.) "What are the four cardinal directions?" Point to each in the room.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep the space very small with only 2-3 objects. Draw the map for them and let them color it. Focus on touching real objects, then finding them on the map. Use simple one-word directions: "up," "down," "left," "right." Let them place stickers on the map rather than draw.

**3-4+ years**:
Draw more of the map themselves. Include 5-6 objects, multiple routes between points. Create a proper legend box. Discuss map scale explicitly: measure the real distance between objects, then agree on a scale (e.g., "1 finger-width on the map = 1 step in real life"). Introduce coordinates: draw a simple grid on the map, label columns A/B/C and rows 1/2/3, and describe object locations by grid square ("The tree is at B2"). Connect to GPS: "Your phone has thousands of satellites helping it know exactly where you are on a giant coordinate grid that covers the whole Earth."

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Neighborhood Walk Map**: Take a photo or draw a simple map of your actual neighborhood (house, mailbox, nearby park, street). Discuss how maps of real places help us not get lost. Walk the route together.

**Variation 2 - Treasure Map**: Hide a small toy or treat in the room. Create a map showing where it is using symbols and a marked path. Let the child use the map to find the treasure. Switch roles - have them hide something and you use their map.

**Repeat Play**: Change the objects in your space each time, redraw the map, and navigate to different locations. Or draw maps of other familiar spaces (bedroom, living room, kitchen) and practice navigating within them. Create maps together of places you visit (grandparent's house, library).

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child draws the map from a front view instead of from above (bird's-eye view).

**Solution**: This is developmentally normal! Use the language "pretend we're a bird flying high up" and physically look down at the space from above before drawing. You might demonstrate by holding a toy bird high above the space and describing what you see from that angle. Expect this to take several exposures before children shift perspective.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand that the symbol "stands for" the real object.

**Solution**: Make the connection explicit and repeatedly. Point to the symbol on the map and say the word ("tree"), then walk to the real tree and touch it saying "real tree." Do this connection 3-4 times. Use very clear, iconic symbols (a circle with scribbles for a tree looks like a tree; a square looks like a house).

**Challenge**: Child wants to navigate by running rather than following the map route.

**Solution**: This is normal! Let them run, but remind them to "look at the map first" and "follow the path on the map." Use the map as the guide even if they're moving quickly. You might say: "The map says go left, so let's run left!"

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Map Real Spaces**: Draw simple maps of your home, yard, or neighborhood. Post them where your child can see and refer to them during daily routines. Point to the map when going to different rooms.

2. **Hunt the Landmark**: Play a game where you describe a landmark ("Can you find the big red mailbox?") and navigate to it together, then discuss what you'd do on a map to show where to find it.

3. **Create a Class or Family Map**: If in a group setting, work together to create a large map of your learning space. Take photos of areas and add them to the map. Update it seasonally or when you rearrange.
