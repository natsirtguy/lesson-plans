# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Market and Sales Activities

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Children learn about economics, social interaction, and community commerce by running a pretend market stall and engaging in role-play transactions as both shopkeepers and customers. Through buying and selling activities, children practice communication skills, learn about exchange and value, and develop confidence in peer interactions while exploring real-world marketplace concepts.

## Vocabulary

**Supply and demand**: Two forces that determine what things cost. Supply is how much of something is available. Demand is how many people want it. When lots of people want something but there isn't much of it (low supply, high demand), the price goes up. When nobody wants something (low demand), the price drops. That's why a rare toy costs more than a common one.

**Scarcity**: When there isn't enough of something for everyone who wants it. Scarcity is the fundamental problem of economics — there's never enough of everything for everyone. If you have only one special painted rock, it's scarce, and people might pay more for it. If you have twenty plain rocks, they're abundant and cost less.

**Profit**: The money left over after you subtract what something cost to make from what you sold it for. If you spend 2 coins buying supplies to make a necklace and sell it for 5 coins, your profit is 3 coins. Profit is the reason businesses exist — it's the reward for creating something people want.

**Medium of exchange**: Anything people agree to use as money. Before coins existed, people used barter — trading goods directly (a chicken for a bag of wheat). But barter is hard because both people need what the other has. Money solves this: it's a medium of exchange that everyone accepts, so you can sell your eggs to one person and use the money to buy bread from someone else.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children set up and run a pretend market stall, taking turns as shopkeepers and customers in simple buying and selling transactions. This hands-on role-play develops social skills, communication, and foundational economic understanding while allowing creative expression through arranging items and engaging in dialogue.

**Activity Type**: Role-playing / Social interaction / Pretend play / Economic exploration

**Duration**: 20-40 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Small items to sell (8-15 pieces): toys, art projects, stones, shells, craft items
- Price markers or tags (cardstock and markers)
- Play money, buttons, or coins (20-30 pieces)
- Containers for display (baskets, boxes, small trays) - 2-3 pieces
- Table or blanket for the stall

**Optional**:
- Decorations for market stall (colorful paper, flowers, cloth)
- Receipt paper and stamps for pretend record-keeping
- Shopping bags or paper bags
- Menus or signs describing items
- Dress-up accessories (aprons, hats)
- Child-made products (playdough items, painted rocks, collages)

**Cost**: Free to $5 (uses household items; optional decorations add minimal cost)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather 8-15 small sellable items (toys, natural objects, craft projects, or art pieces)
2. Create simple price tags with numbers (1-5 for younger children) or pictures
3. Prepare play money, buttons, or coin counters
4. Set up stall location with containers/table for display, positioned at child's eye level
5. Arrange items attractively to encourage browsing; create clear pathway for customers

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   "Today we're going to learn about economics — that's the science of buying, selling, and why things cost what they cost." Show the play money: "Before money existed, people used barter — trading one thing directly for another. But barter was hard: you'd have to find someone who wanted YOUR stuff and had what YOU wanted. Money is a medium of exchange — everyone agrees it has value, so it makes trading much easier."
   Show the stall: "You're going to be a shopkeeper. But here's the key question: how do you decide what price to charge?"

2. **Exploration & Setup** (3-5 minutes):
   Have the child arrange items and SET PRICES. Guide with economics: "Think about scarcity — is this item rare or common? If you only have ONE of this pretty rock, it's scarce. People might pay more for it." "Is there demand for this item? Will people want it? Things people want a lot cost more."
   Help them make price tags using supply-and-demand reasoning: "You have lots of these blocks — high supply. So the price should be lower. But this sparkly stone is the only one — low supply, high demand. That should cost more."

3. **Role-Play as Shopkeeper** (8-15 minutes):
   Take the customer role. Ask about prices and challenge them: "Why does this cost 5 coins but that one costs 2? That's a lot! Is there a reason?"
   Introduce negotiation: "I'll offer you 3 coins instead of 5. Will you accept?" If they refuse: "That's smart — you know the demand is high."
   After a few purchases, run a supply-and-demand experiment: "You sold three of your painted rocks. Now you only have one left. What happens to the price?" (It should go up — lower supply!) "That's supply and demand in action."
   Calculate profit together: "This necklace cost you 2 coins to make. You sold it for 5 coins. Your profit is 3 coins. Profit is what's left after you subtract your costs."

4. **Switch Roles** (5-10 minutes):
   The child becomes the customer. Price items deliberately: some cheap, some expensive. Ask them: "Why do you think this one costs more?" Test their understanding: "I only have one of these left and everyone wants it. What do you think will happen to the price?"
   Introduce the concept of value: "Would you rather buy two cheap items or one special expensive one? That's a trade-off — another economics concept."

5. **Wrap-Up** (2-3 minutes):
   Signal the ending: "We're going to finish our market soon. Let's make this the last round of shopping." Ask reflection questions: "What was your favorite part? Did anyone buy what you thought they would?" Praise specific observations: "You were such a helpful shopkeeper—customers felt welcome!" Make cleanup collaborative: "Let's put all the items back together in this basket." Give the child a specific cleanup role ("You're in charge of collecting the coins"), and count items together during cleanup.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use 4-6 simple items. Simplify to the core concept of exchange: "Give a coin, get an item. That's a transaction." Introduce scarcity concretely: hold up two items, take one away. "Now there's only one left — it's scarce!" Use "medium of exchange" naturally: "This coin is our medium of exchange — it's what we use instead of trading." Keep engagement to 10-15 minutes. The child may primarily enjoy the exchange ritual, and that's real economics learning.

**3-4+ years**:
Use 8-15 items with varied prices based on supply and demand reasoning. Have the child calculate profit: "You made this for 1 coin of supplies. You sold it for 4 coins. How much profit?" Introduce competition: set up two stalls and discuss why customers might choose one over the other (price, quality, variety). Explore price changes: when an item is nearly sold out, ask the child if they should raise the price. Introduce the concept of barter vs. money: try trading items directly without coins to experience the "double coincidence of wants" problem. "You want my apple but I don't want your rock. Barter doesn't work here — that's why money was invented!" Duration can extend to 30-40 minutes.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Farmer's Market Theme**
Set up a vegetable and fruit market using plastic produce, toy animals, or drawings. The child prices vegetables and runs a farm stand. Discuss where food comes from and which fruits/vegetables they like.

**Variation 2: Art Gallery**
The child creates art projects (paintings, collages, sculptures) to sell as a gallery owner. Practice describing artwork: "This is bright and has lots of colors!" Discuss the creative process with customers.

**Variation 3: Toy Store or Treasure Shop**
Create a market for toys or "treasures" (shells, buttons, interesting objects). The child learns to describe features: "It's soft, it's blue, you can squeeze it." Explore the concept of gift-giving: "Someone might buy this for a friend's birthday."

**Variation 4: Holiday or Seasonal Market**
Decorate the stall with seasonal colors and sell holiday-themed items, spring flowers, autumn harvest items, or winter gifts. Explore how markets change with seasons and celebrations.

**Repeat play**: Set up the same market again on another day—the child will be excited by the familiar setup. Change some items across sessions to maintain freshness. Take photos of the market and child in action; create a simple photo book or display showing the stall and play.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't take on the shopkeeper role—prefers to be customer only

**Solution**: Let the child choose their role without pressure. Start with you as shopkeeper several times so the child learns by observation. Gradually increase their involvement (they hand you items, you say "Thank you"). Some children need multiple exposures before feeling confident in a leadership role. This is developmentally normal and will build over time.

**Challenge**: Child is overly focused on the money and wants to hoard coins rather than complete transactions

**Solution**: Use fewer coins initially or switch to non-coin currency (buttons, shells, paper chips). Reframe: "The coins go back in the bank for the next customers to use." Play multiple rounds so coins circulate. Emphasize the items being purchased more than the money. The concept of exchange develops gradually with repeated play.

**Challenge**: Child wants to "sell" favorite toys they don't want to give away

**Solution**: Set clear boundaries before starting: "These are the items for our market. Your teddy bear is your special toy—we don't sell special toys." Designate items together as "market items" vs. "toys we keep." Children feel more ownership and acceptance when they create items specifically to sell (playdough sculptures, drawn pictures).

**Challenge**: Child loses interest after 2-3 minutes

**Solution**: Shorten the activity structure—focus on exploration and one shopping round. Don't force engagement. Revisit on another day; some children need 3-4 exposures before comfort builds. Simplify by reducing items, using toys the child already knows, and reducing conversation demands.

**Challenge**: Multiple children playing together—conflict over roles or items

**Solution**: Rotate roles explicitly with a timer: "First Sarah runs the market for three customers, then Marcus gets a turn." If conflict over items emerges, have duplicates of popular items or introduce items one at a time. Adult facilitates negotiation: "Both of you want to be the shopkeeper. Let's find a solution—Sarah goes first for five minutes, then Marcus."

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Real-world marketplace visit**: Visit a farmer's market, craft fair, or community market. Point out the vendors, items for sale, and transactions. Let your child observe people buying and selling in a real setting.

2. **Create items to sell**: Spend a session making items specifically for a market (painting rocks, creating playdough sculptures, drawing pictures on cards). Develop the child's sense of authorship and investment in the activity.

3. **Community commerce exploration**: Discuss how the family uses markets and shops. Point out vendors and transactions in daily life: "That person is the cashier—they're helping customers with their transaction."
