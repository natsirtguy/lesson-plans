# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Office and Workplace Simulation

## 🎯 Activity Summary

In this activity, children create and explore a pretend office environment where they can experiment with adult work roles, practice communication skills, and engage in imaginative play. By setting up desks, phones, computers, and office supplies, children develop an understanding of how adults work while building literacy, numeracy, and social-emotional skills through role-play. This socio-dramatic play is valuable for developing executive function, perspective-taking, and familiarity with community helpers and workplace concepts.

## Vocabulary

**Goods and services**: The two main things economies produce. **Goods** are physical objects — a chair, a sandwich, a toy. **Services** are things people *do* for others — teaching, designing, answering phones, making decisions. Offices mostly provide services: they organize information, manage decisions, communicate with customers, and coordinate other workers. When you pretend to "work" in an office, you're providing a service.

**Economy**: The whole system of how a society produces, trades, and uses goods and services. Work is part of the economy — in exchange for doing their job (their service), workers receive **wages** or a **salary** (money). That money can then be exchanged for goods and services from other people. The economy is essentially a massive web of exchanges.

**Organizational hierarchy**: Most workplaces are organized in a structure where some people make decisions that guide others' work. A **manager** or **supervisor** coordinates a team; a **CEO** (Chief Executive Officer) makes the biggest decisions for a whole company. Hierarchy exists because large groups need coordination — someone has to decide what the group is working toward and how.

**Colleague**: A person who works alongside you toward a shared goal. Colleagues cooperate, divide tasks, and share information. A colleague is different from a friend or a boss — it's a relationship defined by shared work.

**Communication**: The process of exchanging information — through speaking, writing, email, or signals. Offices run on communication: passing messages, writing reports, making phone calls, holding meetings. Without clear communication, organizations stop functioning.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Are You Sleeping (Frère Jacques)

**Tempo**: Moderate and steady

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*

In my office, in my office,
Writing down, writing down,
Messages and lists and important things to do, messages and lists and important things to do,
Busy day, busy day.

*Verse 2*

On the phone now, on the phone now,
Work is fun here, work is fun here,
Telephones are ringing and we're taking all the calls, telephones are ringing and we're taking all the calls,
All day long, all day long.

**Actions/Gestures**:

1. Pretend to sit at a desk and write on a notepad when singing about "writing down"
2. Hold hand to ear like a phone receiver when singing about being "on the phone"
3. Pretend to organize papers or files on a desk during the longer lines about tasks and calls

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore and play in a pretend office space, taking on different workplace roles and practicing the skills adults use at work. Through dramatic play, they learn about communication, organization, responsibility, and teamwork while developing literacy and social-emotional abilities.

**Activity Type**: Social role-play / Dramatic play / Hands-on exploration

**Duration**: 20-40 minutes (with natural breaks and transitions)

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Child-sized desk or table where children can sit and pretend to work
- Pretend telephone (toy phone or decorated cup with string)
- Paper and writing supplies (crayons, markers, pencils)
- Notebooks or notepads for taking notes
- Child-safe office props (scissors, tape, stapler, pens)
- Name badges or ID cards made from cardstock

**Optional**:
- Toy computer keyboard (disconnected) or mock computer
- Filing cabinet, shelves, or storage boxes for organizing
- Clock or timer for teaching schedules
- Blank business cards for exchanging between "workers"
- Mailbox or mail sorter for postal play
- Calendar or whiteboard for scheduling
- Dress-up clothes (blazers, ties, glasses, hats)
- "Out of Office" or "In Meeting" signs

**Cost**: Free to $10 (most materials from home or recycled items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Clear a large open area or designate a table zone for the "office"
2. Set up furniture to define the workspace (desk, chairs, shelving)
3. Arrange office supplies in accessible containers at child eye-level
4. Create simple signage and name badges
5. Test all toy props for safety (no sharp edges, securely attached)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (3-4 minutes):
   - Show children the office setup and ask: "What do you see here? What do people do in an office?"
   - Share: "Today we're going to pretend to work in an office! But first — do you know WHY people go to work? People work to provide goods or services. An office mostly provides **services** — like organizing information, making decisions, and communicating with other people. The people who do the work get **wages** — that's money they can use to buy things they need."
   - "Offices have different jobs. Someone is usually in charge — that's the **manager** or boss. Others do specific jobs: answering phones, organizing files, sending messages. When everyone does their part, the office works!"
   - Invite each child to choose a role and give them a name badge

2. **Exploration** (5-10 minutes):
   - Let children explore the office setup and materials freely
   - Watch which roles and activities naturally interest them
   - Ask questions: "What does this person do? What would you like to do?"
   - Model simple office activities: sitting at desk, using the phone, writing notes
   - Demonstrate: "I'm calling your office. Ring, ring! Hello!"

3. **Guided Play** (8-20 minutes):
   - Step back and let children lead their own scenarios
   - Ask open-ended questions to deepen play: "What are you writing about? Who is visiting your office? What happens next?"
   - Encourage collaboration: "Your coworker has a phone call. Can you help them?"
   - If play stalls, introduce gentle challenges: "The phone is ringing! Who will answer it?"
   - Join briefly as a "visitor" or "caller" to revive interest if needed

4. **Wrap-up** (3-5 minutes):
   - Give a 5-minute warning: "We'll be finishing office work soon!"
   - Ask reflection questions: "What was the best part of working? What did your job involve?"
   - Celebrate observations: "I noticed you were very busy organizing those papers!"
   - Make cleanup part of the office routine: "Now we need to close the office for the day."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:

Keep the setup very simple with just a desk, phone, paper, and crayons. Use concrete props and provide more direct modeling and participation. Use shorter language ("You're pretending to work") and focus on sensory exploration (touching, holding, scribbling) rather than complex role scenarios. Expect shorter play bursts of 15-20 minutes total with more transitions. You'll be actively playing alongside them, providing narration ("You're writing on the paper!").

**3-4+ years**:

Add more complex office elements like filing systems, appointment books, and computer keyboards. Introduce multiple roles and encourage trading ("Want to be the boss now?"). Expand scenarios ("Your office is very busy today!") and encourage children to create documents like letters, lists, and business cards. Introduce simple money and transactions. Add literacy and numeracy (reading messages, counting papers). Support collaboration on larger multi-person office scenarios. Children may sustain complex play for 30-40+ minutes.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Different Office Types**: Transform the office into different workplace environments. Create a doctor's office with appointment books and health forms, a veterinary clinic with animal patients, a post office with mail sorting, a bank with currency and receipts, or a hair salon with appointment scheduling.

**Variation 2 - Office Technology**: Introduce new "technology" and tools like a computer station with a toy keyboard, a printing and copying area with stamping and hole punches, a fax machine for exchanging pictures between areas, or a conference room table for meetings.

**Variation 3 - Office Services**: Expand to include customers visiting the office. Set up a waiting area with chairs. Children take turns being workers and visitors. Create service scenarios: ordering supplies, making appointments, handling requests politely.

**Repeat play**: Keep the office setup available between sessions for ongoing access, which allows deeper and more complex play to develop. Photograph children engaged in office play as documentation of dramatic play and role-taking skills. Save the "documents" children create (drawings, lists, messages) in a portfolio to show progression of symbolic representation and writing development.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Children won't stay in character or keep interrupting with "but it's pretend"

**Solution**: Frame the play less as "staying in character" and more as "we're pretending together." It's perfectly fine to step in and out of character. Say: "Right, we're pretending! In our pretend office..." Normalize the back-and-forth between play and reality. Your comfort with the playful frame helps them engage.

**Challenge**: One child dominates all the materials or refuses to share roles

**Solution**: Gently introduce the concept that offices have many important jobs. "The receptionist is just as important as the boss!" Create multiple "stations" or "departments" so everyone has something important to do. Sometimes having two "bosses" or two receptionists works better than enforcing strict turns.

**Challenge**: Play becomes chaotic or silly, with running around and shouting

**Solution**: This is normal! You can gently refocus: "In our office, we use quiet voices on the phone." If the office becomes too rowdy, pause and reset: "Let's take a break and get back to work. Offices are usually calm places."

**Challenge**: Child seems bored or disengaged with the office theme

**Solution**: Pivot to a more familiar or interesting scenario. Try a home (pretend kitchen, store, restaurant) or a place the child enjoys (library, veterinary clinic, garden center). The dramatic play skills are what matter—the office is just one context.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Connect to real workplaces**: Visit or talk about workplaces in your community. "Your mom works in an office. Let's create one like hers!" Take photos of real workplace environments to inspire play.

2. **Document learning**: Take photos of children engaged in office play and save the "documents" they create. Celebrate their role-taking: "You were in charge of the phones today!"

3. **Expand with family participation**: If a family member works in an office, invite them to share details about their job. "Tell us about your desk!" or "What's your favorite part of work?" This makes the play feel more meaningful and relevant.
