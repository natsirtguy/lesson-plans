# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Patterns and Systems

## Activity Summary

In this lesson, children explore the fascinating world of patterns—discovering how patterns appear in nature, in everyday objects, in sounds, and in how we think and organize our world. Through hands-on exploration and play, children learn to recognize, create, and predict patterns, building foundational mathematical thinking and observational skills that help them understand the world around them.

## Vocabulary

**Pattern**: A sequence of things that repeats in an orderly, predictable way. Patterns can be visual (stripes, spots), auditory (rhythms), numerical (1, 2, 3…), or behavioral (daily routines).

**System**: A group of parts that work together and follow rules. A weather system, a solar system, and even a daily schedule are all systems — the parts interact in predictable, patterned ways.

**Fibonacci sequence**: A famous number pattern where each number is the sum of the two before it: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13… Nature uses this sequence constantly — count the spirals on a sunflower or pinecone and you'll almost always land on a Fibonacci number.

**Fractal**: A pattern that looks the same at different scales — when you zoom in, you see the same shape repeated. Tree branches, coastlines, snowflakes, and ferns are all fractals. The small parts look like miniature versions of the whole.

**Tessellation**: A pattern of shapes that fit together perfectly with no gaps or overlaps, like bathroom tiles or a honeycomb. Honeybees build hexagonal (six-sided) tessellations because hexagons are the most efficient shape for storing honey.

**Symmetry**: When both sides of something match — a butterfly's wings, a human face, or a leaf. Radial symmetry (like a starfish or flower) means the pattern repeats around a central point.

**Predict**: To say what comes next based on the pattern already seen. Pattern recognition is one of the brain's most powerful tools — your brain is constantly predicting what comes next based on past patterns.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Patterns, patterns, all around, all around
Patterns, patterns, all around, everywhere we see
We can predict what comes next
Find the sequence, check for symmetry
Patterns, patterns, all around, all around

*Verse 2*
Red then blue then red then blue, red then blue
Red then blue then red then blue, that's a pattern true
We can predict, it's red again
See the sequence plain and clear for you
Patterns, patterns help us learn, help us learn

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point all around while singing "patterns, patterns, all around"
2. Tap knees in alternating pattern for "red then blue"
3. Touch head then indicate thinking for "predict what comes next"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will explore four kinds of patterns: mathematical (number and color sequences), natural (Fibonacci in nature, fractal branching), social (daily routine sequences), and thinking patterns (how our brains use pattern recognition). They'll create patterns with materials, discover Fibonacci numbers in real objects, and begin understanding how systems — collections of interacting parts — generate patterns.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on exploration and creation

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Small objects for pattern creation (buttons, blocks, pasta shapes, pom-poms, or small toys)
- String or yarn (for threading patterns)
- Picture cards or photos showing patterns (stripes, spots, checkerboard)
- Containers for collecting and sorting

**Optional**:
- Natural items (leaves, twigs, pebbles, flowers)
- Patterned fabric or wallpaper samples
- Drum or simple percussion instrument for rhythm patterns
- Colored tape for creating visual patterns on the floor

**Cost**: Free (using household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather materials in small bowls or containers (separate colors and shapes)
2. Have picture cards ready showing different pattern types
3. Clear a work surface where materials won't roll away
4. Test materials to ensure they're safe for small hands (no choking hazards)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Mathematical patterns** (3-4 min):
   Start with a simple repeating sequence using blocks or buttons: "Red, blue, red, blue — what comes next? Your brain already knows, because it spotted the pattern!" Build the sequence together, then try a growing pattern: 1 block, then 2 blocks, then 3 — "This one keeps getting bigger! That's called a growing pattern." Introduce the Fibonacci idea verbally: "There's a famous pattern called the Fibonacci sequence — 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 — each number is the sum of the two before it. Nature loves this pattern!"

2. **Natural patterns** (4-5 min):
   Look at a real pinecone, sunflower head, or photos if outdoors is unavailable. Count the spiral rows going one direction, then the other. Say: "Sunflowers almost always have 34 spirals one way and 55 the other — Fibonacci numbers! Nature discovered mathematics before humans did." Examine a leaf: "See the veins branching off into smaller branches, which branch into even smaller ones? That repeating-at-every-scale pattern is called a fractal." Tear a piece of broccoli apart and show how each floret looks like a mini version of the whole head. If outside, look at tree branches — same pattern.

3. **Social patterns** (2-3 min):
   "People make patterns too! What's the first thing you do every morning?" Walk through the daily routine together (wake up → eat → get dressed → play). "That sequence repeats every day — it's a social pattern! Why do you think routines are useful?" Discuss: predictability helps our brains relax because we don't have to figure everything out fresh each day.

4. **Create and predict** (4-5 min):
   Child makes their own pattern with objects. Caregiver covers the last few items and asks: "What comes next? How do you know?" Encourage the child to explain their reasoning — this is the "thinking pattern" element. "Your brain spotted the rule and used it to predict. That's pattern recognition — one of the most powerful things brains do!"

5. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   "We found patterns in numbers, in nature, in our daily lives, and in how our brains work. When many patterns work together — like day and night, seasons, and weather all following rules — that's a *system*." Sing a verse from the learning song.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on simple AB repeating patterns (red-blue-red-blue) and recognizing when something repeats. Use the Fibonacci language lightly — "this is nature's favorite number pattern" — without requiring understanding. Point out fractals in broccoli or leaves and say "it keeps repeating the same shape!" Let the child feel the rhythm of patterns rather than needing to articulate the rule. Social patterns (daily routines) are often the most intuitive entry point at this age.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce the actual Fibonacci sequence: count it out together (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8). Try to find the spirals on a pinecone and count them. Discuss the difference between repeating patterns (AB) and growing patterns (1, 2, 3…). Ask: "What's the rule this pattern is following?" Explore what happens when you break a pattern — why does it feel wrong? Introduce the word "system" and list examples: weather system, digestive system, a game with rules. "Every system follows patterns."

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Body Patterns**: Create patterns using body movements (stomp-clap-stomp-clap, or jump-spin-jump-spin). This combines gross motor skills with pattern recognition and is great for kinesthetic learners.

**Variation 2 - Pattern Walk**: Create a pattern on the floor using tape or chalk (big circle-small circle-big circle pattern) and have children walk, hop, or skip through it. Discuss the pattern as they move through it.

**Repeat play**: After the first session, introduce new materials or challenge them with more complex patterns. Use real natural items collected from outside. Play pattern games: "I'm thinking of a pattern—can you guess it?" or "Can you find patterns around the house?" Keep patterns fresh by rotating materials and settings (sometimes on the floor, sometimes at a table, sometimes outside).

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't recognize the repeating part of a pattern
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal! Children this age are still building pattern recognition skills. Slow down and emphasize the repeating part by saying it aloud repeatedly ("Red-blue, red-blue, red-blue"). Use your finger to point to each repeat. Make the pattern physically obvious with high contrast colors or very different shapes. Start with just 2-3 repetitions of the pattern rather than longer sequences.

**Challenge**: Child wants to arrange items randomly rather than following a pattern
**Solution**: That's exploratory play, which is valuable too! You might guide them gently: "I see you're putting buttons down. What if we made a pattern? Let's try red, blue, red, blue together." If they're not interested in patterns today, that's perfectly fine. Some children need more time with free exploration before they're ready for structured patterns. Come back to patterns another time.

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated when making mistakes in a pattern
**Solution**: Reassure them that patterns are learning games, not tests. "Oops! That's okay. Let's see... what comes next? A blue one! You got it!" Celebrate their attempts warmly. Make patterns playful and low-pressure. If they're genuinely upset, switch activities and try again another day.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Fibonacci hunt**: Look for Fibonacci numbers in nature on walks. Pinecones, sunflowers, flower petals (most flowers have 3, 5, 8, or 13 petals — all Fibonacci). Count petals on a daisy together. "Nature's counting system!"

2. **Fractal drawing**: Draw a big Y shape (a branch). On each tip of the Y, draw a smaller Y. Repeat. Watch a fractal tree grow from one simple rule repeated over and over. Discuss: "A real tree grows the same way — the same branching rule, over and over."

3. **Pattern necklace with a rule**: String beads with a deliberate rule (every third bead is a different color, or 1 red, 2 blue, 1 red, 2 blue). Say the rule aloud while making it. Ask: "If I kept going forever, what would the 20th bead be?"
