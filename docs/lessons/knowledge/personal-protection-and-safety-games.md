# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Personal Protection and Safety Games

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces young children to personal safety concepts through playful games and role-play. Children learn to recognize safe boundaries, practice saying "no," identify trusted adults, and understand that their body belongs to them—all in an age-appropriate, empowering, and non-scary way.

## Vocabulary

**Boundary**: An invisible line around your body that shows how close other people can be. When someone asks before giving you a hug, they are respecting your boundary.

**Trusted Adult**: A person in your life who keeps you safe, listens to you, and helps you when you need it—like a parent, teacher, or grandparent.

**Alert**: Being awake and paying attention to what's happening around you. When you stay alert, you notice when something feels wrong.

**Consent**: When you agree that someone can do something to you or near you, like giving permission for a hug or holding hands.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

**Tempo**: Slow and gentle

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*

When touch doesn't feel okay,
I tell an adult I trust,
My body is just for me,
Safety starts inside of me.

*Verse 2*

No means no, I always can,
Always ask before you hug,
Ask before you touch me please,
I'm proud of my body strong.

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Cross arms gently across chest when singing "My body is just for me"
2. Point to self, then to a trusted adult when singing "I tell an adult I trust"
3. Hold hands or give thumbs up when singing "I'm proud of my body strong"

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Think of 2-3 trusted adults in your child's life (parent, grandparent, teacher)
2. Identify a safe, open space where you can move freely
3. Check in with your own feelings—approach this with calm, positive energy
4. Decide which games best match your child's comfort level

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Sit together and say: "Today we're going to play some special games about our bodies and staying safe. Your body is special and belongs to you. Let's talk about that!"

   Ask: "Who are the safe, trusted adults in your life?" Help them identify 2-3 people by name.

2. **Exploration** (10-12 min):

   **Game 1: Boundary Bubble** (4-5 min)
   - Stand facing your child with your arms at your sides
   - Explain: "Imagine there's an invisible bubble around your body. That's your space."
   - Take a slow step toward them and ask: "Is this okay?" If they back up, respect it immediately
   - Step back and ask: "What about now?" Help them find their comfortable distance
   - Take turns—let them "step toward" you and practice respecting YOUR space
   - Emphasize: "Different people and different times might feel different. That's okay!"

   **Game 2: Practice Saying No** (3-4 min)
   - Practice saying "No!" together with different voices: silly voice, strong voice, quiet voice, whisper
   - Explain: "Your 'no' is important and powerful. You can say no to things that don't feel good."
   - Act out simple scenarios: "Can I have a hug?" Child responds with "Yes" or "No"
   - If they say no, accept it cheerfully: "Okay! I respect that. High five instead?"
   - Let them practice asking you: "Can I hold your hand?" and accept their answer either way

   **Game 3: Who Are My Safe People** (2-3 min)
   - Draw or point to pictures of trusted adults in your child's life
   - Practice saying their names together
   - Say: "If something doesn't feel right, you can tell [safe person's name]"
   - Create a simple visual: Draw or take photos and label "My Safe People"
   - Practice the phrase together: "I need help" or "That doesn't feel okay"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Ask reflection questions:
   - "What was your favorite game?"
   - "When is it okay to say no?"
   - "Who are the people you can tell if something feels wrong?"
   - "How does it feel when someone respects your space?"
   - "What does a boundary feel like?"

4. **Wrap-up** (1-2 min):
   Affirm: "Your body is special and belongs to you. You're in charge of it. You can always say no, and trusted adults will listen and help keep you safe."
   Sing the learning song together, or just one verse.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus mainly on identifying and naming trusted adults
- Keep games very short and simple (5 minutes total)
- Use stuffed animals to act out scenarios instead of involving real people directly
- Practice simple phrases: "My body" and "Safe person"
- Keep the tone playful and positive—no scary concepts
- Don't discuss "unsafe" situations; focus on who to go to for help

**3-4+ years**:
- Explore more complex scenarios: "What if a friend wants to hug but you don't feel like it today?"
- Introduce all vocabulary words (boundary, consent, alert) and use them naturally
- Practice saying no with more confidence and in varied situations
- Discuss that people can ask before touching, and it's okay to say yes or no
- Ask more reflection questions to build critical thinking
- Encourage their ideas: "What would you do if...?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Safe Person Role-Play**
Act out a scenario where the child needs help. Pretend something feels uncomfortable and practice approaching a trusted adult: "I don't like that. Can you help me?" This practices the actual behavior they'd use.

**Variation 2: Feelings Check-In Daily**
Create a habit: "How does your body feel today?" or "Do your shoulders feel happy/safe today?" This builds body awareness and teaches children to notice when something feels uncomfortable.

**Repeat play**: Change the scenarios and games each time. Ask the child for ideas: "What safety game should we play today?" or "Who else is a safe person we can practice with?" This keeps it fresh and gives them agency.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child seems anxious or scared about safety topics
**Solution**: Scale back immediately. Focus only on identifying trusted adults. Use stuffed animals instead of role-play with you. Avoid language like "bad people" or "danger." Keep the tone positive and empowering. If the child has experienced trauma, consult a professional before diving deeper into safety conversations.

**Challenge**: Child resists saying "no" or setting boundaries (very people-pleasing)
**Solution**: This is completely normal for some children! Practice in low-pressure, playful ways. Praise any attempt: "You said no! That's so brave!" Remind them boundaries are healthy. Model it yourself: "I don't feel like a hug right now—high five instead?" Normalize saying no in everyday situations.

**Challenge**: Child asks scary questions ("What if a bad person takes me?" or "What if nobody helps?")
**Solution**: Validate the question without feeding fear. Respond honestly but simply: "There are many safe grown-ups who help keep you safe, like your mom and dad." Redirect to what they CAN control: "You can always tell a trusted adult if something feels wrong." If anxiety persists or interferes with daily life, talk to a professional.

**Challenge**: You feel uncomfortable discussing these topics
**Solution**: Your comfort level matters—children pick up on adult anxiety. Take deep breaths. Remember the goal is to empower, not frighten. Start simple and build gradually. If you experienced trauma, consider your own healing before having these conversations with your child.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Body Check-In**: Each day, ask "Does your [body part] feel happy/safe today?" Build a habit of listening to their body's signals.

2. **Create a "Safe People" Visual**: Make a simple poster or book with photos or drawings of trusted adults. Review it together regularly and add people as appropriate.

3. **Casual Reinforcement Throughout the Week**: Weave reminders into daily conversation: "You can always tell me if something doesn't feel right" or "Your body belongs to you—you're in charge of it." Repetition helps concepts stick without making it a "lesson."
