# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Personal Protection and Safety Games

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces young children to personal safety concepts through playful games and role-play. Children learn to recognize safe boundaries, practice saying "no," identify trusted adults, and understand that their body belongs to them—all in an age-appropriate, empowering, and non-scary way.

## Vocabulary

**Boundary**: A limit around your body or personal space that defines what feels comfortable and what doesn't. Boundaries are normal and healthy — every person has them. When someone asks before touching you, they are respecting your boundary. Children have the right to set boundaries even with adults they know.

**Consent**: Freely given permission for something to happen. Real consent means saying yes when you actually want to, without feeling pressured. A yes that comes from feeling scared or pressured isn't real consent. This applies at all ages — toddlers who say "no" to a hug are practicing consent.

**Private body parts**: The parts of the body covered by a bathing suit — for girls: chest, bottom, and genitals (vulva, vagina); for boys: penis, testicles, bottom. Child safety researchers and pediatricians strongly recommend using anatomically correct terms. Children who know the real names can communicate clearly if something happens and are more likely to be believed and helped. Vague nicknames make it harder for children to report and for adults to understand.

**Body signals**: The physical sensations your body sends when something feels wrong — a stomach that feels tight or upset, a fast heartbeat, a shivery feeling, or a sense of wanting to run away. These signals come from a part of the brain called the amygdala, which scans for danger automatically. Teaching children to notice and trust these signals gives them an early warning system. "If your tummy feels funny or your heart feels scared, that's your body telling you something."

**Safe secrets vs. unsafe secrets**: Safe secrets are temporary surprises that feel good and will be revealed soon (a birthday present). Unsafe secrets are things that someone told you to keep forever and that make you feel scared, confused, or bad inside. A trusted adult would never ask a child to keep an unsafe secret. Children should always be able to tell their safe people about anything — there are no secrets too big to share with a trusted adult.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children engage in interactive games that teach personal safety concepts: recognizing safe boundaries, practicing saying "no," identifying trusted adults, and understanding their body autonomy. These games are playful and empowering, designed to build confidence rather than create fear.

**Activity Type**: Role-play and imaginative games

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: Minimal (5 minutes)

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Open space to move around
- A list of 2-3 trusted adults in the child's life
- Your calm, positive energy and enthusiasm

**Optional**:
- Stuffed animals or dolls for role-play scenarios
- Picture cards showing different people
- Chart paper to draw "My Safe People"
- Soft objects for the boundary game

**Cost**: Free

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Think of 2-3 trusted adults in your child's life (parent, grandparent, teacher)
2. Identify a safe, open space where you can move freely
3. Check in with your own feelings—approach this with calm, positive energy
4. Decide which games best match your child's comfort level

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Sit together and say: "Today we're going to play some special games about our bodies and staying safe. Your body is special and belongs to you. Let's talk about that!"

   Introduce the concept of body signals: "Your body is really smart — it sends you signals when something doesn't feel right. Has your tummy ever felt weird or tight when something was scary? That's your brain sending a signal. We're going to learn to listen to those signals."

   Name the private parts simply and directly: "The parts of your body covered by a bathing suit are your private parts. They have real names: [use anatomically correct terms appropriate to the child]. Your private parts belong only to you. Doctors sometimes check them to keep you healthy, and parents help you stay clean — but those are the only times, and it's always okay to ask what's happening."

   Ask: "Who are the safe, trusted adults in your life?" Help them identify 2-3 people by name.

2. **Exploration** (10-12 min):

   **Game 1: Boundary Bubble** (4-5 min)
   - Stand facing your child with your arms at your sides
   - Explain: "Imagine there's an invisible bubble around your body. That's your space."
   - Take a slow step toward them and ask: "Is this okay?" If they back up, respect it immediately
   - Step back and ask: "What about now?" Help them find their comfortable distance
   - Take turns—let them "step toward" you and practice respecting YOUR space
   - Emphasize: "Different people and different times might feel different. That's okay!"

   **Game 2: Practice Saying No** (3-4 min)
   - Practice saying "No!" together with different voices: silly voice, strong voice, quiet voice, whisper
   - Explain: "Your 'no' is important and powerful. You can say no to things that don't feel good."
   - Act out simple scenarios: "Can I have a hug?" Child responds with "Yes" or "No"
   - If they say no, accept it cheerfully: "Okay! I respect that. High five instead?"
   - Let them practice asking you: "Can I hold your hand?" and accept their answer either way

   **Game 3: Who Are My Safe People** (2-3 min)
   - Draw or point to pictures of trusted adults in your child's life
   - Practice saying their names together
   - Introduce the secrets distinction: "There are safe secrets — like a birthday surprise that you'll share soon. And there are unsafe secrets — when someone says 'don't ever tell anyone' and it makes you feel scared or bad inside. If anyone ever asks you to keep an unsafe secret, you tell a safe person right away. Safe people would never want you to keep unsafe secrets."
   - Practice the phrase together: "I need to tell you something" — and practice an adult responding warmly: "I'm so glad you told me. I believe you."

   **Game 4: Body Signal Check-In** (1-2 min)
   - Ask: "Can you feel your heartbeat? Put your hand on your chest." Take a deep breath together.
   - "When something feels wrong, your heart might beat faster and your tummy might feel tight. That's your brain saying 'pay attention!' It's called a body signal."
   - Practice: "What would your body feel like if someone made you uncomfortable?" vs. "What does your body feel like when you're cozy and safe?"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Ask reflection questions:
   - "What was your favorite game?"
   - "When is it okay to say no?"
   - "Who are the people you can tell if something feels wrong?"
   - "How does it feel when someone respects your space?"
   - "What does a boundary feel like?"

4. **Wrap-up** (1-2 min):
   Affirm: "Your body is special and belongs to you. You're in charge of it. You can always say no, and trusted adults will listen and help keep you safe."
   Sing the learning song together, or just one verse.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus mainly on identifying trusted adults and naming private body parts correctly
- Use the real anatomical terms matter-of-factly — no need to make them a big deal
- Keep games very short (5 minutes total) using stuffed animals to act out scenarios
- Practice simple phrases: "That's my private part" and "I'll tell [safe person]"
- Introduce body signals simply: "Does your tummy feel cozy or tight right now?"
- Keep the tone calm and empowering — not scary

**3-4+ years**:
- Use all vocabulary words naturally: boundary, consent, private parts (anatomical names), body signals, safe/unsafe secrets
- Explore the secrets distinction: practice distinguishing safe secrets (birthday surprise) from unsafe secrets (something that makes your tummy feel bad)
- Ask about body signals: "What does your body feel like when you're happy? Scared? Uncomfortable?"
- Practice consent in multiple contexts: hugs, holding hands, tickling, sharing belongings
- Reinforce: "It's always okay to tell me anything. There is nothing too big or too scary to share with a safe person."

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Safe Person Role-Play**
Act out a scenario where the child needs help. Pretend something feels uncomfortable and practice approaching a trusted adult: "I don't like that. Can you help me?" This practices the actual behavior they'd use.

**Variation 2: Feelings Check-In Daily**
Create a habit: "How does your body feel today?" or "Do your shoulders feel happy/safe today?" This builds body awareness and teaches children to notice when something feels uncomfortable.

**Repeat play**: Change the scenarios and games each time. Ask the child for ideas: "What safety game should we play today?" or "Who else is a safe person we can practice with?" This keeps it fresh and gives them agency.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child seems anxious or scared about safety topics
**Solution**: Scale back immediately. Focus only on identifying trusted adults. Use stuffed animals instead of role-play with you. Avoid language like "bad people" or "danger." Keep the tone positive and empowering. If the child has experienced trauma, consult a professional before diving deeper into safety conversations.

**Challenge**: Child resists saying "no" or setting boundaries (very people-pleasing)
**Solution**: This is completely normal for some children! Practice in low-pressure, playful ways. Praise any attempt: "You said no! That's so brave!" Remind them boundaries are healthy. Model it yourself: "I don't feel like a hug right now—high five instead?" Normalize saying no in everyday situations.

**Challenge**: Child asks scary questions ("What if a bad person takes me?" or "What if nobody helps?")
**Solution**: Validate the question without feeding fear. Respond honestly but simply: "There are many safe grown-ups who help keep you safe, like your mom and dad." Redirect to what they CAN control: "You can always tell a trusted adult if something feels wrong." If anxiety persists or interferes with daily life, talk to a professional.

**Challenge**: You feel uncomfortable discussing these topics
**Solution**: Your comfort level matters—children pick up on adult anxiety. Take deep breaths. Remember the goal is to empower, not frighten. Start simple and build gradually. If you experienced trauma, consider your own healing before having these conversations with your child.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Body Check-In**: Each day, ask "Does your [body part] feel happy/safe today?" Build a habit of listening to their body's signals.

2. **Create a "Safe People" Visual**: Make a simple poster or book with photos or drawings of trusted adults. Review it together regularly and add people as appropriate.

3. **Casual Reinforcement Throughout the Week**: Weave reminders into daily conversation: "You can always tell me if something doesn't feel right" or "Your body belongs to you—you're in charge of it." Repetition helps concepts stick without making it a "lesson."
