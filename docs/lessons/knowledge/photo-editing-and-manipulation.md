# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Photo Editing and Manipulation

## 🎯 Activity Summary

In this activity, young children explore the creative possibilities of digital photography and simple image manipulation through hands-on experimentation with technology. Children will take photos of themselves, objects, or nature, then use age-appropriate tools to modify, filter, or combine images in playful ways. This activity bridges the gap between traditional visual arts and contemporary digital creativity, helping children understand that art can be created and transformed through technology.

## Vocabulary

**Pixel**: Short for "picture element" — the smallest building block of a digital image. Every photo on a screen is a grid of millions of tiny colored squares, each one a pixel storing a single color value. A 12-megapixel phone camera captures 12,000,000 pixels per photo. If you zoom in very far on a digital image, you can eventually see the individual square pixels — when zoomed in too far, the image looks "pixelated" (blocky) because you've gone below the image's resolution.

**RGB**: The color model used by digital screens — every color displayed on a screen is created by combining just three tiny colored lights: Red, Green, and Blue. R=0,G=0,B=0 is black (all lights off); R=255,G=255,B=255 is white (all lights full). This is additive color mixing — the opposite of paint. Red + Green light = yellow. Red + Blue = magenta. All three = white. Your eye has three types of color-sensitive cone cells that detect red, green, and blue wavelengths — screens exploit this exactly.

**Composition**: The deliberate arrangement of subjects within a frame. Photographers use rules like the "rule of thirds" — mentally dividing the image into a 3×3 grid and placing subjects where the lines cross — because the visual cortex naturally looks to those zones first. Good composition uses foreground and background depth, leading lines, and negative space (empty areas that give the eye room to breathe).

**Filter**: A digital process that mathematically adjusts pixel values to change a photo's appearance. A black-and-white filter converts each pixel's RGB values to a single brightness number (called luminance). A "warm" filter increases red and orange channel values while reducing blue values. Professional photographers use RAW files — unprocessed pixel data — giving more range for filtering and adjustment than compressed JPEG images.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Are You Sleeping (Frère Jacques)

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
Taking photos, taking photos
Of the things we see
Filters changing, filters changing
Colors dancing free
Make them silly, make them pretty
Colors shine so bright

*Verse 2*
Purple pictures, purple pictures
Yellow, black, and white
Swirling, whirling, transformation
Digital art at night
Every edit, every color
Brings us joy and light

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Frame a square with both hands (like taking a photo) when you sing "taking photos"
2. Wave hands in a rainbow motion when you sing "colors dancing" or "purple pictures"
3. Point to eyes and then around the room to indicate seeing and noticing things

**Activity Type**: Digital creation/Visual arts/Creative exploration

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks for younger children)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Tablet or smartphone with camera capability (one device per child or shared)
- Simple photo editing app (age-appropriate and free options):
  - Google Photos (built-in editing features)
  - Snapseed (beginner-friendly filters and tools)
  - PicsArt Kids (specifically designed for young learners)
  - Pixlr (intuitive interface with fun effects)
- Subject for photography (objects around home, outdoor items, self-portraits)

**Optional**:
- Props for photo subjects (stuffed animals, colorful fabrics, natural items)
- Tripod or phone stand for hands-free photography
- Color printer to print selected edited photos for display

**Cost**: Free to $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Download and install chosen photo editing app on device(s)
2. Test the app to ensure it works smoothly and is age-appropriate
3. Ensure device battery is charged
4. Gather props or identify photography subjects
5. Practice one simple edit to demonstrate confidently

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Show the child a photo you've taken on the device. Say: "Look at this photo! We can do something fun—we can change how it looks using this app. We can add colors, make it silly, or change it in cool ways!" Take one quick photo together (perhaps of their hand or a toy) and show them the image immediately to build excitement.

2. **Exploration** (5-10 min):
   Let the child point the camera at different objects, themselves using selfie mode, or things around the space. Encourage them to take 3-5 photos of different subjects (a toy, their face, a plant, the window). Talk about what they're capturing: "You took a photo of the bear! It looks happy." Celebrate each photo and point out colors and interesting things they've noticed.

3. **Discovery** (7-10 min):
   Open one photo in the editing app. Demonstrate ONE simple tool clearly:
   - For filters: Show 2-3 filter options and let them tap one they like. "The black-and-white filter takes away all the color information and keeps only the brightness of each pixel"
   - For brightness: Show how a slider works — "This adds or subtracts light from every single pixel in the photo, all at once"
   - For effects: Show a fun effect and explain: "This filter changes the numbers stored in millions of pixels simultaneously — that's how computers make changes so fast"

   **Pixel exploration**: Zoom in on a photo as far as possible. "See those tiny squares? Those are the individual pixels — each one is storing just one color value. The photo is made of millions of them!" Compare zoomed vs. normal view.

   **RGB light mixing**: "Screens make all colors from just three tiny lights — red, green, and blue — this is different from how paints work. Mixing red paint and green paint makes brown, but mixing red LIGHT and green LIGHT makes yellow!"

   Hand control to the child: "Your turn! Pick which one YOU like." Ask guiding questions: "Do you like this better? Does this look funny? Which pixels changed the most?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Review the photos they created: "Look at all the cool things you made!" Ask: "Which one is your favorite? Why do you like that one?" Save or export favorite edited photos. Discuss what's next and help them put the device away safely.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on taking photos rather than detailed editing. Use only 1-2 pre-selected simple filters. The adult primarily operates the app while the child directs ("Take a picture of the dog!"). Keep editing to one simple step per photo. Prioritize the excitement of seeing themselves or familiar objects on screen. Duration: 10-15 minutes. Adult support: High, with child making creative choices.

**3-4+ years**:
Allow more independence with tapping and exploring options. Introduce 2-3 different types of editing tools (filters, brightness, effects). Encourage experimentation with different subjects and angles. Ask them to describe what changed: "How is this photo different from before?" Try combining effects or doing multiple edits on the same photo. Introduce the concept of "favorite" and comparing edited versions. Duration: 20-30 minutes.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Photo Collection Story
Take 4-5 photos to create a simple sequence, edit each one differently, then arrange them in order to "tell a story"—like a wordless comic strip. Talk about what happens in each picture.

**Variation 2**: Filter Challenge
Play a game: "Can you make this photo look silly? Now make it look calm. Now make it look like nighttime." Try different filters to match the feelings or themes you describe.

**Repeat play**: Create a simple ritual—"Photos, then edits, then save"—that becomes predictable and understood. Follow the child's interests: if they love selfies, take lots of selfies; if they get excited about black-and-white filters, spend more time there.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to take 50+ photos and never wants to stop editing.

**Solution**: Set clear expectations before starting: "We're going to take 4 photos today, then pick 2 to edit." Use a visual timer so they understand when the activity ends. Celebrate that you can "come back to this another day" rather than trying to do everything at once.

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated when they accidentally close the app or undo an edit they liked.

**Solution**: Keep a calm, reassuring tone: "No problem! We can take that photo again." Screenshot or note which edits they liked so you can recreate them. Show them the "undo" button for future reference.

**Challenge**: Child is passive and wants you to do all the tapping and editing.

**Solution**: Simplify to 2-3 options only. Place your hand near theirs to guide finger placement: "Your finger goes here, then you tap." Celebrate even accidental presses: "You did that! Look what happened!" Start with activities requiring less precision (like tapping a big filter button) before swiping.

### Follow-Up Activities
1. Print favorite edited photos and create a refrigerator display or simple photo album together
2. Email or message selected photos to grandparents or family members who will celebrate the work
3. Create a simple slideshow of edited photos to review together, building memory and pride in the work
