# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Photography collection and albums

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces children to collecting and organizing photographs, creating a personal album, and understanding how images capture special moments and memories. Children will sort, arrange, and display photos while developing organizational skills, narrative thinking, and connections to their family history.

## Vocabulary

**Photograph**: A picture taken with a camera that captures what something or someone looks like at that exact moment in time

**Collect**: To gather things together and keep them because you find them interesting, special, or important

**Organize**: To arrange things in order or into groups that make sense, like by color, person, or activity

**Album**: A special book or folder made to keep photos safe, together in one place, and easy to look at and enjoy

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

**Tempo**: Slow and gentle

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 6 lines each):

*Verse 1*
Pictures tell our stories true
Moments caught for me and you
Gather them and organize
Put them in our album bright
Sorted and arranged with care
Show the people that we love

*Verse 2*
Look and smile at all these days
Memories we save and hold
See the growth and joy we've known
Organize them neat and safe
Photos show the things we love
Albums help us to recall

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Pretend to hold a camera, click the button, and smile big
2. Make sorting motions with hands, separating photos into groups

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will create their own photo collection by sorting, arranging, and displaying photographs in a simple album format. They can use real family photos, printed images, or magazine cutouts to build a personalized collection while learning about categorization, memory, and storytelling.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on collection and sorting activity

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Photographs (printed family photos, magazine cutouts, or digital prints)
- Paper, cardboard, or foam board for album base
- Glue stick, tape, or sticky dots
- Child-safe scissors (optional, adult-supervised)

**Optional**:
- Photo album pages with plastic sleeves
- Decorative items (stickers, washi tape, ribbons)
- Index cards or labels for writing names/dates
- Markers or colored pencils

**Cost**: Free (using existing family photos) to $5 (printing or materials)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather and print photographs or cut images from magazines (aim for 6-10 photos)
2. Pre-cut large images into manageable sizes for small hands
3. Set up work surface with glue, photos, paper/cardboard base, and labels
4. Have a finished example album available to show child
5. Safety check: ensure all scissors and small items are stored safely

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Show child a real family photo album or picture book
   - Point to a photo: "This is you at the park! Remember when we played there?"
   - Explain simply: "Today we're going to make our own special photo collection that tells our story!"
   - Show the materials: "We'll pick photos we love and put them together."

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   - Spread photos out where child can see them all
   - Ask: "Can you find a picture of someone we know?" or "Show me a picture with colors you like"
   - Guide sorting: "Let's put all the pictures with people together" or "Which ones are from outside?"
   - Child arranges photos on the album base in their preferred order
   - Help child attach photos with glue, tape, or sticky dots
   - As you glue, narrate: "This picture goes here because it's special to you!"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   - Point to each photo and ask: "Who is in this picture?" "What are we doing?" "Do you remember this?"
   - Notice details together: "Look at that big smile!" or "You were so little then!"
   - Ask: "Which is your favorite photo and why?"
   - Help child label photos: write names, dates, or simple captions

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   - Celebrate: "You made an amazing album! You're such a good collector!"
   - Display in a special place: shelf, wall, or family photo area
   - Plan to return to it: "We can look at our memories together whenever we want!"
   - Talk about adding new photos soon: "Next week we can add more pictures!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use only 4-6 large, clear photos of familiar people and places
- Focus on very simple sorting: "people" vs. "things" or "inside" vs. "outside"
- Use stickers and tape instead of glue (easier for small hands to manipulate)
- Keep labeling to single words: "Baby," "Dog," "Home"
- Adult does most of the gluing; child places photos and presses down
- Shorter activity (10-12 minutes)

**3-4+ years**:
- Use 8-12 photos with varied topics and settings
- Sort by multiple categories: who's in it, what activity, where it was, what we were doing
- Let child use glue stick more independently (with light guidance)
- Create themed collections: "People We Love," "Places We've Been," "Things We Do"
- Child can help write captions with adult's assistance: "This is Grandpa at the beach"
- Encourage child to arrange photos in sequence or create a story
- Longer activity (18-20 minutes)

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Timeline Album**: Create an album showing growth and change over time. Include baby photos, recent photos, and photos from different seasons or years. Talk about how the child has changed and what they can do now.

**Variation 2 - Themed Photo Collections**: Instead of one album, create separate collections for different themes: Family Members, Pets, Outdoor Adventures, Holidays, or Favorite Foods. Sort and organize each theme in its own section or folder.

**Repeat play**: Add new family photos to the album every week. Have child help organize and arrange the new additions. Revisit the album during quiet time and ask child to tell stories about the memories. Notice new details each time you look together.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes focused on cutting photos but lacks fine motor control for safe scissor use
**Solution**: Offer pre-cut images or magazine clippings instead. If cutting is important to the activity, supervise very closely and cut together. Use the opportunity to say: "We're being very careful with our special memories."

**Challenge**: Child loses interest or becomes frustrated with gluing, taping, or arranging
**Solution**: Keep the initial activity to 10-12 minutes maximum. Use quick-adhesive options like sticky dots or tape instead of glue to speed up the process. Remember that the value is in the process and conversation, not a perfect final product. Offer lots of praise for effort.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't seem to understand the connection between a photo and a memory
**Solution**: Narrate constantly and emotionally as you work together. "This is you eating birthday cake! Your birthday was so special. You were so happy!" Make explicit connections to events the child experienced recently and might remember.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Memory Review**: During quiet time, sit together and flip through the album. Ask about specific photos and encourage the child to recall details and feelings about that moment.

2. **Photo Tour**: Have the child show and explain the album to other family members. This builds confidence and reinforces memory connections.

3. **Weekly Updates**: Make adding new photos a regular weekly tradition. Let the child help select which new photos to include and where they should go.

4. **Photo Games**: Play "I Spy" using the photos as the game board. Hide small objects or details within pictures for the child to find.

5. **Sorting Variations**: Revisit the same photos weekly and practice sorting them in different ways: by color, by person, by activity, or by season.

6. **Story Creation**: Encourage the child to use photos as prompts to tell stories: "Tell me what happened right before this photo was taken."
