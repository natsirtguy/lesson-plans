# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Pottery and Clay Work

## Activity Summary

Children explore clay as a transformable, tactile material by squeezing, rolling, shaping, and sculpting. This hands-on experience develops fine motor skills while introducing the concept of how materials respond to touch and pressure, connecting them to pottery traditions from around the world while celebrating the artistic process over product.

## Vocabulary

**Sculpt**: To shape and mold clay or other materials with your hands into different forms and designs.

**Texture**: The way something feels when you touch it, like smooth, bumpy, rough, or squishy (clay has wonderful changing textures).

**Tactile**: Related to the sense of touch; experiences you have through feeling and touching with your hands.

**Manipulate**: To handle, control, and change something using your hands and fingers (like shaping clay into new forms).

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

**Tempo**: Slow and gentle

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
Clay is soft, I squeeze and knead
Rolling, pushing, what a treat
Shape it now into a ball
Make it squiggly, big or small
With my hands I twist and turn
Smooth and bumpy—what I learn

*Verse 2*
Press and poke and squeeze so tight
Clay creations feel just right
I can make a pot or snake
Any shape is mine to make
Clay is special, soft and new
Look at what my hands can do

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Squeezing motion with both hands, as if holding and pressing clay
2. Rolling hands together in circular motions, as if making a clay ball
3. Stretching and shaping arms, twisting hands in the air to show transforming clay

## Intro Video Recommendation

**Recommended search**: Search YouTube for "clay play for toddlers" or "pottery for young children"

**What to look for**:
- 2-5 minutes long
- Adult hands demonstrating simple clay shaping (rolling, squishing, poking)
- Calming background music
- Emphasis on exploration and sensory experience, not final products
- Bright, natural lighting showing clay colors and textures

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will have a sensory-rich experience with clay, exploring how it responds to different hand movements and pressures. They'll create simple shapes and forms while developing hand strength, coordination, and understanding of cause-and-effect. The focus is on the process of exploration and the satisfaction of manipulating the material, not on creating recognizable objects.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration and fine motor play

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Play dough or air-dry clay (store-bought or homemade)
- Smooth work surface (wooden board, mat, or clean table)
- Small containers of water
- Damp cloth for cleanup

**Optional**:
- Simple tools: plastic knives, popsicle sticks, rolling pins, or forks
- Natural items to press: leaves, twigs, shells, pine cones
- Cookie cutters (large, plastic)
- Sponges for texture

**Cost**: Free to $5 (homemade clay costs pennies; store-bought play dough is $2-5)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Cover work surface with washable mat or newspaper to catch clay bits
2. Place clay in a bowl or on a plate, with one portion available for each child
3. Set up water in small containers and damp cloth nearby for hand-wiping
4. Ensure area has no small choking hazards mixed with clay

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Let children observe and smell the clay first without touching
   - Ask: "What color is it? How do you think it feels?"
   - Demonstrate: squeeze a small ball of clay and let them see it change
   - Invite: "Let's discover what YOUR hands can do with clay"

2. **Exploration** (8-12 min):
   - Give each child a ball of clay about the size of their fist
   - Encourage free exploration with open-ended prompts:
     - "What happens when you squeeze it hard?"
     - "Can you make it longer?"
     - "Feel how it's soft... now squish it flat"
     - "Roll it between your hands"
     - "Poke it with your fingers"
   - Play the learning song softly in background
   - Join in the exploration alongside them, modeling different movements
   - Show how tools (if using) can poke, press, or mark the clay

3. **Discovery** (3-4 min):
   - Point out observations: "Look, when you pressed hard, it got thinner"
   - Celebrate varied creations: "You made something so bumpy!"
   - Ask questions: "What does it feel like now? Warmer? Softer?"
   - If children create shapes, acknowledge without labeling (let them describe it)
   - Invite them to feel texture: "Touch your creation—is it smooth or bumpy?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   - Gather clay and place back in container
   - Wash hands together with warm water
   - Display finished creations on a low shelf if using air-dry clay
   - Transition to next activity

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use only squeezing and rolling movements to avoid overwhelming
- Provide large pieces of clay (grapefruit-sized) for easier manipulation
- Skip tools entirely; focus on hands-only exploration
- Keep duration to 10-15 minutes
- Expect sensory exploration to be primary goal
- Use only food-safe, non-toxic clay (in case of mouthing)
- Allow repetition of the same movements many times

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce tools (plastic knife, fork, rolling pin) for complex texturing
- Add challenges: "Can you make it into a long snake?" or "Poke holes all over"
- Introduce cookie cutters or leaf-pressing for pattern-making
- Extend duration to 15-20 minutes
- Encourage naming creations if they wish
- Try mixing two colors to observe color blending
- Save creations to dry and display in a "gallery"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Nature Textures**: Press leaves, twigs, and shells into clay to create imprinted patterns. Talk about how nature has its own textures.

**Variation 2 - Color Mixing**: If using colored play dough, combine two colors and observe how they blend into new colors (blue and yellow make green).

**Repeat Play - Rolling Adventure**: Focus on rolling clay into increasingly long "snakes"—can they roll it longer than their arm? Shorter than a pencil?

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child tries to eat the clay or becomes frustrated with the material

**Solution**: If using homemade or store-bought play dough, it's safe if tasted (though salty and unpleasant). Homemade dough can be made completely edible with flour, salt, water, and food coloring. Frustration often indicates the clay is too stiff; warm it by kneading it yourself first, or add a tiny drop of water. Younger toddlers may need shorter sessions.

**Challenge**: Clay gets stuck to clothing, hands, or surfaces; child becomes distressed by messiness

**Solution**: Have a wet cloth very nearby for quick hand-wiping. Wear aprons or old clothes. Clay flakes off easily once dried. Some children are sensory-sensitive and need reassurance: "The clay is just being sticky—it comes right off when we wash."

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or won't touch the clay at all

**Solution**: Some children need time. Don't force engagement. Let them watch you play, or try a different activity alongside them. Warming clay makes it feel less stiff and more inviting. Some prefer cooler clay—there's no wrong temperature.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Texture Hunt**: After clay play, search your home for other textured items (rough sponge, smooth stone, bumpy pinecone) and compare to the clay's feel.

2. **Painting Creations**: If you've saved air-dry clay sculptures, paint them with washable paints the next day for another layer of sensory and creative exploration.

3. **Handprints in Clay**: Press your palm or child's hand into a ball of clay to make a print—a keepsake of their hand size and strength at this age.
