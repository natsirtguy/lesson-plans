# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Public Speaking and Presentation

## Activity Summary

Children learn the fundamentals of speaking confidently to an audience through playful performance and sharing activities. This lesson builds verbal expression, listening skills, and self-assurance as children practice sharing ideas, telling stories, and showing their creations to others in a supportive environment.

## Vocabulary

**Confidence**: Feeling sure and brave enough to try something, even when others are watching. When you show your drawing to the class without being shy, you're showing confidence.

**Articulate**: To speak clearly and slowly so that others can understand every word. Using a big voice and clear sounds when you say "I made a tower" is articulating.

**Communicate**: To share thoughts, feelings, and information with other people using words, expressions, and actions. When you tell your friend what you did at the park, you're communicating.

**Audience**: The group of people listening to or watching you share. Your family at the dinner table is an audience when you tell them about your day.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: The Itsy Bitsy Spider

**Tempo**: Upbeat and encouraging

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
When I speak with confidence, I stand up tall and strong
Articulate my words so clear, the audience hears my song
I communicate my thoughts and share what's on my mind
When I speak with confidence, kind words I always find

*Verse 2*
Standing here before you now, I'm ready to present
My confidence is growing strong with every word I've sent
The audience is listening to everything I say
I articulate and communicate in my own special way

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Stand tall with shoulders back to show confidence
2. Point to mouth and speak clearly to demonstrate articulating
3. Gesture outward to the audience with open arms

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children take turns presenting something they've created or chosen to a small group. They practice standing, speaking clearly, and receiving positive feedback while building confidence in sharing their ideas and creations with an audience. This hands-on activity directly addresses the core skill of public speaking in an age-appropriate, low-pressure environment.

**Activity Type**: Performance and presentation practice / Group sharing

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Items children have created (drawings, block towers, Play-Doh creations) or can bring from home
- A small audience (even 2-3 people works well)
- A special "presenter spot" (rug, carpet square, or tape line on floor)
- A simple bell, chime, or hand clap to signal turn-taking

**Optional**:
- A pretend microphone (paper towel tube, cardboard paper roller)
- Simple applause sign made from paper
- Certificate of "Great Presenter" printouts
- A small podium or step stool to stand on
- Toy audience members (stuffed animals, dolls) if real audience is unavailable

**Cost**: Free (using items on hand) to under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Arrange seating in a semicircle facing a clear "presenter spot" (2-3 feet in front of the audience)
2. Gather 3-4 items that children can present (drawings, creations, or objects from around the house)
3. Review with children what good listening looks like: eyes watching, ears listening, staying quiet, clapping at the end
4. Explain that everyone gets a turn to be the presenter

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Explain: "Today we are going to be presenters! A presenter is someone who shares something special with a group. The people listening are the audience."
   - Model once: Hold up an item (your drawing, a toy, a block), stand in the presenter spot, say in a clear voice: "I made a tower today. I used red and blue blocks. It is very tall."
   - Ask the group to clap and say "Great job!"

2. **Exploration** (10-15 min):
   - Invite the first child to choose an item to share
   - Guide them to the presenter spot and encourage them to:
     - Stand still (or sit up straight if on the floor)
     - Look at the audience
     - Use a big, clear voice
     - Tell 2-3 sentences about their item
   - If a child is shy, help them by asking leading questions: "Can you tell us the color?" "What did you use to make this?"
   - After each presentation, guide the audience to clap and say "Nice job!" or "We liked your presentation!"
   - Continue with each child's turn

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   - Ask children reflective questions:
     - "How did it feel to be a presenter?"
     - "What did you like about listening to your friends?"
     - "Who was brave today?"
   - Point out specific moments: "I noticed [child's name] used such a clear voice!" or "[Child] looked right at us while speaking!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   - Celebrate all presenters with a group round of applause
   - If desired, give out certificates or stickers
   - Transition: "You are all wonderful speakers and presenters!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Keep presentations very short (just naming the item is fine: "Tower!" or "Picture!")
- Use very simple language and model sentences they can repeat back
- Allow children to sit while presenting if standing feels uncomfortable
- Have a smaller audience (just one or two people) to reduce anxiety
- Offer tangible encouragement: stickers, high-fives, immediate applause
- Accept any communication (pointing, sounds, single words) as valid sharing

**3-4+ years**:
- Encourage 2-3 sentences about their item
- Ask follow-up questions to extend their speaking: "What's your favorite part?" "How did you make it?"
- Introduce simple turn-taking with a "talking object" (the microphone tube) that you pass between presenters
- Add a "question time" where audience members ask the presenter simple questions
- Challenge them to use descriptive words: "What color is it?" "Is it big or small?"
- Encourage eye contact and standing still throughout their presentation

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Story Presentation**: Instead of objects, children create a simple 2-3 page story (or you create one together) and present it page by page. They practice sequencing and narration.

**Variation 2 - Talent Show**: Children present a talent or skill (singing a song, doing a dance, showing a trick) rather than an object. This builds confidence in performance.

**Variation 3 - Museum Opening**: Transform the room into a museum where children are the artists presenting their artwork to "visitors." Take turns being the visitor and the presenter.

**Repeat play**:
- Present the same item multiple times over several days to build confidence
- Rotate the audience size (start with 1 person, work up to larger groups)
- Have children practice presentations at mealtimes to family members
- Create a "presentation portfolio" of items they've successfully presented

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is very shy and refuses to stand up or speak in front of others.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal for young children. Start with just one trusted adult as the audience. Allow them to sit down. Let them whisper their words first, then gradually encourage a bigger voice. Never force participation. Sometimes being in the audience first helps them warm up. Praise any attempt at communication, no matter how small.

**Challenge**: Child monopolizes the presentation time, talks too long, or won't stop.
**Solution**: Set a clear timer (even 30 seconds for young toddlers). Use a bell or chime as a signal that time is up. Make it playful: "The bell just rang—time for next presenter!" Practice the concept of "taking turns" separately. Some children need physical reminders (a hand on their shoulder, moving them gently back to their seat).

**Challenge**: Other children in the audience distract the presenter or are disruptive.
**Solution**: Have a clear rule about audience behavior before starting. Practice "being a good listener" together. If a child can't sit still, give them a job (holding the applause sign, being the bell-ringer). Keep the audience very small for the first few attempts. Seat potentially disruptive children near you for support.

**Challenge**: Child becomes emotional (frustrated, shy, or upset) when presenting.
**Solution**: Take a break. Offer comfort and reassurance: "It's okay to feel nervous. Everyone feels that sometimes." Don't force them to continue. Try again another day. Never shame a child who gets upset. Present the concept as play, not performance, to reduce pressure.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Sharing at Mealtimes**: Start a family tradition where each person shares one thing from their day at dinner. Model going first with excitement and clear voice.

2. **Video Recording**: Once children are comfortable, record their presentations on your phone and let them watch themselves. This builds self-awareness and often boosts confidence for the next attempt.

3. **Presentation in Unexpected Places**: Have them present to the family pet, a stuffed animal audience, or a sibling. This takes pressure off perfect presentation and makes it playful.

4. **Listen and Respond**: Practice active listening by having the audience ask one simple question after each presentation: "What was your favorite part?" This teaches children that good communication is two-way.

5. **Real-World Practice**: Point out presenters in daily life: "That person on TV is a presenter—see how they're speaking to us?" Help children recognize public speaking in everyday contexts.
