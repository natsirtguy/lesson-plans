# Arts & Culture Activity: Public Speaking and Presentation

## Activity Summary

Public speaking and presentation for young children focuses on building confidence, encouraging self-expression, and developing communication skills in a supportive environment. Children will practice sharing ideas, telling stories, showing their creations, and performing for others, building foundational confidence in expressing themselves. This activity is valuable because it develops language skills, emotional confidence, and the ability to communicate with others—essential skills for social development and future learning.

**Activity Type**: Performing arts/Communication/Social activity/Creative expression

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Mess Level**: Low—primarily verbal/movement based with minimal materials

**Best Environment**: Large open area or circle space indoors, or outdoor gathering space with good acoustics

## Complete Activity Setup

### Materials Needed

**Essential materials**:
- Comfortable gathering space (rug, circle of chairs, or cushions)
- Simple props (optional): stuffed animals, picture books, or objects from around the home
- Chart paper or whiteboard (to draw story ideas)
- Small microphone substitute (optional): toy microphone, paper towel tube decorated, or just a hand gesture

**Optional enhancements**:
- Dress-up items (hats, scarves, costumes)—adds confidence and fun character exploration
- Picture cards or sequence cards—helps with storytelling structure
- Musical instrument or bell—signals presentation time and creates excitement
- Backdrop or special presentation area—creates "stage" feeling and focus
- Certificate or special ribbon—celebrates participation and courage
- Camera or phone—documents presentations for family sharing

**Cost estimate**: Free to under $5 (likely using items already at home)

**Preparation time**: 5-10 minutes (mainly space arrangement and materials gathering)

### Step-by-Step Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Create a clear, safe gathering space with good visibility for all participants
2. If using any props or dress-up items, arrange them where children can easily access them
3. Have comfortable seating arranged in a semicircle or circle so presenter is visible to audience
4. Remove distracting toys or items that might pull attention away

**Environment setup**:
- Clear floor or rug for movement and presentation
- Good lighting so faces are visible
- Quiet or controlled background noise (turn off TV/music)
- If possible, create a slight "stage" area—even just a different colored rug or chair platform works
- Arrange audience seating so the child presenter can see friendly faces

**Cleaning supplies ready**:
- N/A (minimal cleanup needed—mainly tidying the space afterward)

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Start with excitement and warmth: "Today we get to share and perform! Who has a story or idea to show everyone?"
- Model confidence yourself: "I'm going to share a silly poem, and then you can have a turn!"
- Explain that everyone is the presenter at some point: "We all get to be the star today—our job as listeners is to watch and listen kindly"
- Make it feel like celebration, not evaluation: "There's no right or wrong way to share—we're just happy to hear from you!"

**Setting expectations**:
- "When it's your turn to present, you stand here and everyone looks at you—it's okay to feel nervous, that's normal!"
- "As listeners, we watch with happy faces and listen to our friend. When they're done, we clap or cheer!"
- "You can share anything: a story, a dance, a song, something you made, or just talk about your favorite thing"
- Emphasize process over perfection: "What matters is that you're brave and you try—we're proud of you!"

### Main Activity (10-20 minutes)

**Phase 1: Modeling and Building Confidence** (3-5 minutes)
Adult demonstrates first to show that sharing is safe and fun:
- Tell a very simple story (2-3 sentences): "One day, my teddy bear went to the beach. He played in the sand. Then he went swimming!"
- Or perform a simple movement: dance move, silly walk, funny pose
- Or share something authentic: "I like blue because it reminds me of the sky!"
- Keep it brief, silly, and warm to reduce pressure
- Invite responses: "That was fun! Who wants to go next?"

**Phase 2: Individual Presentations** (7-15 minutes)
Each child takes a turn as presenter:
- Give them choice: "Do you want to tell a story, sing a song, show a dance, or talk about something you like?"
- Offer supports if they're shy: "Would you like to hold this microphone?" "Should I stand next to you?" "Do you want a stuffed animal to help you?"
- Ask simple prompts if they freeze:
  - "What's your favorite animal? Tell us about it!"
  - "If you had a magic wand, what would you do?"
  - "Show us your best dance move!"
  - "Tell us something funny that happened"
  - "What's your favorite food? Why?"
- Let them present at their own pace—no rushing
- Celebrate their effort with genuine enthusiasm and applause

**Phase 3: Audience Participation** (ongoing)
Other children practice being supportive audience members:
- Model active listening: nod, smile, make eye contact
- Teach audience response: "Let's give a big clap!" "Yay! Great job!"
- For interactive presentations: encourage questions or requests ("Can you tell us another story?" "Show us that dance again!")

**Adult role**:
- Be a warm, encouraging presence—smile frequently
- Provide emotional safety: "It's okay to feel nervous; I'm here with you"
- Ask gentle follow-up questions: "Tell us more about that!" "What happened next?"
- Don't correct or critique—focus on celebration and courage
- Offer just enough support to help them succeed, but encourage independence
- Model the behavior you want to see: kind listening, genuine interest, enthusiastic response

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Celebrate all presenters: "Everyone was so brave today! I loved hearing from each of you!"
- Reflection: "What did you like about sharing today?" or "How did you feel when you presented?"
- Optional: give out simple certificates or special stickers celebrating "Brave Presenter" or similar
- If recorded, offer to share the video with families or keep for the child's portfolio

**Transition to cleanup**:
- Children help tidy the presentation space together: "Let's put our chairs back and reset our circle"
- Frame it positively: "You did such important work today—let's take care of our space together"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Approach**:
- Keep presentations VERY short—30 seconds to 1 minute maximum
- Heavy adult support: you may sit with them as they present
- Focus on non-verbal forms of sharing: pointing, showing, simple sounds/movements
- They might present: a favorite toy, a funny face, a simple move, a sound they like
- Use lots of props and familiar objects to give them something to hold onto
- Small group or one-on-one presentations work better than large groups (reduces anxiety)
- Accept pointing, babbling, or gestures as valid "presentations"
- Don't require words—they can show and move instead

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes total (very short individual turns)

**Adult support**: Very high—sit with them, hold their hand, help them feel safe, do some of the "presenting" with them

### 3-4+ years
**Extensions**:
- Presentations can be 2-3 minutes with more detail and storytelling
- Encourage them to practice beforehand: "What story will you tell?"
- Add planning element: "Let's draw a picture of your story first, then you can tell it"
- Introduce simple props or costume pieces to deepen character play
- Teach them to use a louder voice and look at audience: "Everyone should be able to hear and see you"
- Encourage longer stories with beginning, middle, end
- They can present in pairs: "You and your friend can tell a story together"
- Introduce simple "interview" questions: "Who, what, where, when, why?"
- Celebrate specific details: "I loved when you said... Tell us more about that part!"

**Duration**: They may engage for 20-30 minutes or longer with good energy and interest

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Story Theater**
Children tell a story while others act it out. Child is narrator, others are characters. Builds storytelling skills and gives shy kids a role that feels safer (directing rather than performing).

**Variation 2: Talent Show Theme**
Create a more formal "show" with a schedule, audience seating, and simple "intermissions" between acts. Children can practice a talent (song, dance, joke, trick) and perform it. Adds structure and excitement.

**Variation 3: Character Show and Tell**
Children bring a stuffed animal or toy and present AS that character. Child does the voice and movements. Reduces performance anxiety because they're "hiding" behind the character.

**Variation 4: Question and Answer Time**
Adult or older child asks the presenter questions about their story/idea, and they answer. Builds conversational skills and gives them something to respond to rather than just perform.

**Variation 5: Song and Movement Presentation**
Focus on singing, dancing, or movement rather than talking. Use songs you know (nursery rhymes, fingerplays) or make up simple movements. Great for kinesthetic learners.

**Thematic variations**:
- Seasonal themes: "We're putting on a winter show!" or "Fall talent show!"
- Holiday performances: practice songs or dances for family gatherings
- Book character presentations: dress up as a favorite book character and act out scenes
- Travel adventures: "Tell us about a place you've been or want to go"
- Joke and riddle show: children share jokes or riddles they know

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Public speaking and performance are fundamental forms of human expression found in every culture. Storytelling has been how humans preserve history, share knowledge, and build community for thousands of years. Theater, performance, and presentation are central to cultural celebration and artistic expression across civilizations. Learning to express oneself confidently is valued across cultures as essential to education, community participation, and personal development.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Show examples of different performance traditions: music from different countries, storytelling from different cultures, dance styles
- Discuss how different cultures celebrate with performances: festivals, ceremonies, gatherings
- Read books featuring performers and storytellers from diverse backgrounds
- Listen to music and stories from around the world
- Talk about how people in different places share ideas and express themselves

**Books/Media**:
- "The Lion and the Mouse" (Aesop's Fables)—classic storytelling with characters
- "Pete the Cat" by James Dean—great for character performance and singing
- "Corduroy" by Don Freeman—character a child can relate to and perform as
- "The Tale of Despereaux" by Kate DiCamillo—beautiful storytelling example

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child refuses to present or freezes up with shyness
**Why**: Stage fright, fear of judgment, or perfectionism are normal developmental experiences; some children need more time to warm up to performance
**Solution**: Never force participation. Instead, offer: "You don't have to go today—you can watch and maybe try next time." Let them observe first. Then next time, they might sit in the "stage" area but stay quiet. Gradually they'll present. Build confidence with very small steps. Consider one-on-one practice before group presentations. Offer props or "hiding places" like puppets or stuffed animals to reduce exposure.

**Challenge**: Child talks too quietly and no one can hear
**Why**: Shy, anxious, or just naturally soft-spoken; they need practice projecting their voice
**Solution**: Model a loud, confident voice: "Listen to my big voice!" Practice together: "Now use your big voice like me!" Use a real or pretend microphone to make them feel louder. Have them practice telling the story to just one person first, then a small group, then larger. Praise effort: "You're using such a strong voice today!"

**Challenge**: Child's story/presentation is confusing or hard to follow
**Why**: Language development is still emerging; they may skip steps or jump around with excitement
**Solution**: Ask gentle questions to help clarify: "What happened first?" "Then what?" This helps them organize their thinking. Don't correct them—just help structure. Accept their version as it is; the goal is expression, not perfection. Over time, with practice, organization improves naturally.

**Challenge**: Other children interrupt, laugh, or don't listen respectfully
**Why**: Young children are still learning social skills and impulse control; some may feel nervous and react by being silly
**Solution**: Teach listening skills explicitly: "When someone is presenting, we listen with quiet bodies and kind faces." Practice this together with your own presentations. Use a signal (raising hand, ringing bell) to indicate "presentation time." Redirect interrupting children kindly: "It's [child's] time right now; you can ask a question when they're done." Model active listening enthusiastically so children see what you expect.

**Challenge**: Performance anxiety is extreme—child has panic response
**Why**: Some children have genuine anxiety; pressure to perform can feel overwhelming
**Solution**: Completely remove performance pressure. Let them participate differently: introduce the presenter, hand out materials, help manage the group. They can present to just one trusted adult. They can present a pretend show with no audience. Progress slowly. Consider this a longer-term goal if the child has significant anxiety. The goal is to build confidence, not traumatize. Some children just need more time.

### Tips for Success
- **Start small**: Begin with you presenting, then very small individual moments, building up to group presentations
- **Celebrate effort, not perfection**: "I loved how brave you were!" means more than "That was the best story ever!"
- **Make it safe to mess up**: If you forget a line, pause, or get silly, model recovery: "Oops, I forgot! Let me try again. That's okay!"
- **Use props as confidence builders**: Holding something gives nervous kids something to do with their hands and a "hiding place"
- **Practice beforehand**: Let kids practice their presentation with just you first—they'll be more confident with the group
- **Give them control**: Let them choose what to share, whether to wear a costume, etc. Control reduces anxiety
- **Watch for overstimulation**: Group settings can be overwhelming; small groups or one-on-one work better for some kids
- **Create a "safe audience"**: Start with just family, close caregivers, or one friend rather than strangers
- **Record presentations**: They can practice watching themselves, which builds confidence and is wonderful to keep for memories

### What to Do With the Creation
- **Create a portfolio**: Keep recordings or photos of presentations over time—shows growth and builds confidence when child can see progress
- **Share with family**: Send video clips or photos to grandparents or relatives who will celebrate enthusiastically
- **Display certificates or photos**: Put "Brave Presenter" certificates on the wall or in a special book
- **Practice for repeat performances**: "You did such a great job—would you like to tell that story again for Grandpa?"
- **Document in learning journal**: Write down the story they told or describe their performance; it's a memory treasure
- **When to let go**: Don't keep recordings or mementos forever if child doesn't want them; follow their lead on what's special to keep
