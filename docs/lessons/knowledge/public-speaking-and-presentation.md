# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Public Speaking and Presentation

## Activity Summary

Children learn the fundamentals of speaking confidently to an audience through playful performance and sharing activities. This lesson builds verbal expression, listening skills, and self-assurance as children practice sharing ideas, telling stories, and showing their creations to others in a supportive environment.

## Vocabulary

**Rhetoric**: The art of persuasive speaking, studied for over 2,400 years since Aristotle wrote about it in 350 BCE. Aristotle identified three tools of persuasion: **ethos** (the speaker's credibility — do they know what they're talking about?), **pathos** (emotional appeal — does it make the audience feel something?), and **logos** (logical argument — does the evidence support the claim?). Every great speech uses all three.

**Projection**: Using your **diaphragm** (the dome-shaped muscle below your lungs) to push air through your **larynx** (voice box), where your **vocal cords** vibrate to produce sound. Ancient Greek amphitheaters held 14,000 people with no microphones — speakers projected by breathing from their diaphragm, which pushes more air and produces louder sound without straining the throat. Whispering uses only about 10% of your lung capacity; projection uses 70-80%.

**Body language**: The nonverbal signals your body sends while you speak. Research by Albert Mehrabian found that when words and body language conflict, people believe the body language. Standing tall activates your **trapezius** and **erector spinae** muscles, which actually reduces cortisol (stress hormone) and increases testosterone (confidence hormone). Eye contact activates the listener's **fusiform face area** and **mirror neurons**, creating a sense of connection.

**Oratory**: The practice of formal public speaking, from Latin "orare" (to speak). History's great orators shaped civilizations: Demosthenes (ancient Greece) overcame a speech impediment by practicing with pebbles in his mouth. Cicero (ancient Rome) developed the five canons of rhetoric: **invention** (finding arguments), **arrangement** (organizing them), **style** (choosing words), **memory** (remembering the speech), and **delivery** (performing it). Martin Luther King Jr. used all five in "I Have a Dream."

## Learning Song

**Tune**: The Itsy Bitsy Spider

**Tempo**: Upbeat and encouraging

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
When I speak with confidence, I stand up tall and strong
Articulate my words so clear, the audience hears my song
I communicate my thoughts and share what's on my mind
When I speak with confidence, kind words I always find

*Verse 2*
Standing here before you now, I'm ready to present
My confidence is growing strong with every word I've sent
The audience is listening to everything I say
I articulate and communicate in my own special way

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Stand tall with shoulders back to show confidence
2. Point to mouth and speak clearly to demonstrate articulating
3. Gesture outward to the audience with open arms

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children take turns presenting something they've created or chosen to a small group. They practice standing, speaking clearly, and receiving positive feedback while building confidence in sharing their ideas and creations with an audience. This hands-on activity directly addresses the core skill of public speaking in an age-appropriate, low-pressure environment.

**Activity Type**: Performance and presentation practice / Group sharing

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Items children have created (drawings, block towers, Play-Doh creations) or can bring from home
- A small audience (even 2-3 people works well)
- A special "presenter spot" (rug, carpet square, or tape line on floor)
- A simple bell, chime, or hand clap to signal turn-taking

**Optional**:
- A pretend microphone (paper towel tube, cardboard paper roller)
- Simple applause sign made from paper
- Certificate of "Great Presenter" printouts
- A small podium or step stool to stand on
- Toy audience members (stuffed animals, dolls) if real audience is unavailable

**Cost**: Free (using items on hand) to under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Arrange seating in a semicircle facing a clear "presenter spot" (2-3 feet in front of the audience)
2. Gather 3-4 items that children can present (drawings, creations, or objects from around the house)
3. Review with children what good listening looks like: eyes watching, ears listening, staying quiet, clapping at the end
4. Explain that everyone gets a turn to be the presenter

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - "For over 2,400 years, humans have studied how to speak well in front of others. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle called this 'rhetoric.' He said every good speaker needs three things: ethos — that means you know what you're talking about; pathos — you make the audience feel something; and logos — what you say makes sense."
   - Demonstrate projection: "Watch — when I speak quietly from my throat" (whisper), "you can barely hear me. But when I breathe from my diaphragm — the big muscle under my lungs — and push air through my vocal cords..." (project clearly), "my voice fills the room. Greek theaters held 14,000 people with no microphones. They all used diaphragm projection."
   - Model a brief presentation using all three of Aristotle's tools: "I made this tower [ethos — I know about it because I made it]. I'm really proud of it because it was hard to balance [pathos — emotion]. It has five blocks and it's the tallest tower I've built [logos — evidence]."

2. **Exploration** (10-15 min):
   - Practice projection first: everyone place a hand on their stomach. "Breathe in — feel your diaphragm push your belly out. Now say 'HELLO' while pushing your belly in. That's diaphragm projection."
   - Invite the first child to present. Before they start, remind them: "Stand tall — that activates your trapezius and erector spinae muscles in your back, and research shows it actually changes your brain chemistry to feel more confident. Look at the audience — when you make eye contact, mirror neurons in the listener's brain fire, creating a feeling of connection."
   - After presenting, analyze together: "You told us you MADE it — that's ethos. You said you LIKED it — that's pathos. You described what it LOOKS like — that's logos. You just used all three of Aristotle's tools!"
   - For the audience: "Good listening is part of rhetoric too. The audience's body language — nodding, leaning forward — sends signals back to the speaker that encourage them."

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   - "Which part of Aristotle's rhetoric did you use the most — ethos, pathos, or logos?"
   - "Did you feel different when you stood tall versus when you slouched? That's body language — your posture changes both how the audience perceives you AND how your own brain responds."
   - "Demosthenes, one of ancient Greece's greatest orators, had a speech impediment as a child. He practiced speaking with pebbles in his mouth to strengthen his articulation. Every great speaker became great through practice, not talent."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   - "Today you practiced rhetoric — the 2,400-year-old art of persuasive speaking. You used diaphragm projection to make your voice carry, body language to communicate confidence, and Aristotle's three tools: ethos, pathos, and logos."
   - "Cicero, a Roman orator, said there are five parts to any speech: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. Today we practiced delivery. Next time we can work on invention — coming up with what to say."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus on projection: practice diaphragm breathing with hand on belly — "breathe in, belly out; speak, belly in"
- Even one word projected from the diaphragm is a real rhetorical act — celebrate it
- Model Aristotle's three tools yourself and label them: "I'm using pathos right now — I'm telling you how I feel about this"
- Practice body language: stand tall vs. slouch — let them feel the physical difference
- Accept any communication (pointing, sounds, single words) as valid oratory — Demosthenes started somewhere too
- Small audience (1-2 people) keeps cortisol low, which helps Broca's area (speech production) function better

**3-4+ years**:
- Explicitly use Aristotle's framework: before each presentation, ask "What's your ethos? Your pathos? Your logos?"
- Practice vocal variety: loud/soft, fast/slow, high/low pitch. "Your vocal cords vibrate faster for high pitch and slower for low pitch. Varying pitch keeps the audience's auditory cortex engaged."
- Add a Q&A period — this teaches impromptu speaking, which Cicero considered the hardest form of oratory
- Analyze body language: "When you crossed your arms, what message did that send? When you opened your arms wide, how did that change things?"
- Introduce the concept of the "rule of three" — "Three points are memorable. Aristotle had three types of persuasion. Cicero said good speakers inform, delight, and persuade. Martin Luther King Jr. said 'free at last, free at last, thank God almighty we are free at last.' Three is powerful."
- Record their presentations and watch back — self-observation builds metacognitive awareness of one's own speaking patterns

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Story Presentation**: Instead of objects, children create a simple 2-3 page story (or you create one together) and present it page by page. They practice sequencing and narration.

**Variation 2 - Talent Show**: Children present a talent or skill (singing a song, doing a dance, showing a trick) rather than an object. This builds confidence in performance.

**Variation 3 - Museum Opening**: Transform the room into a museum where children are the artists presenting their artwork to "visitors." Take turns being the visitor and the presenter.

**Repeat play**:
- Present the same item multiple times over several days to build confidence
- Rotate the audience size (start with 1 person, work up to larger groups)
- Have children practice presentations at mealtimes to family members
- Create a "presentation portfolio" of items they've successfully presented

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is very shy and refuses to stand up or speak in front of others.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal for young children. Start with just one trusted adult as the audience. Allow them to sit down. Let them whisper their words first, then gradually encourage a bigger voice. Never force participation. Sometimes being in the audience first helps them warm up. Praise any attempt at communication, no matter how small.

**Challenge**: Child monopolizes the presentation time, talks too long, or won't stop.
**Solution**: Set a clear timer (even 30 seconds for young toddlers). Use a bell or chime as a signal that time is up. Make it playful: "The bell just rang—time for next presenter!" Practice the concept of "taking turns" separately. Some children need physical reminders (a hand on their shoulder, moving them gently back to their seat).

**Challenge**: Other children in the audience distract the presenter or are disruptive.
**Solution**: Have a clear rule about audience behavior before starting. Practice "being a good listener" together. If a child can't sit still, give them a job (holding the applause sign, being the bell-ringer). Keep the audience very small for the first few attempts. Seat potentially disruptive children near you for support.

**Challenge**: Child becomes emotional (frustrated, shy, or upset) when presenting.
**Solution**: Take a break. Offer comfort and reassurance: "It's okay to feel nervous. Everyone feels that sometimes." Don't force them to continue. Try again another day. Never shame a child who gets upset. Present the concept as play, not performance, to reduce pressure.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Sharing at Mealtimes**: Start a family tradition where each person shares one thing from their day at dinner. Model going first with excitement and clear voice.

2. **Video Recording**: Once children are comfortable, record their presentations on your phone and let them watch themselves. This builds self-awareness and often boosts confidence for the next attempt.

3. **Presentation in Unexpected Places**: Have them present to the family pet, a stuffed animal audience, or a sibling. This takes pressure off perfect presentation and makes it playful.

4. **Listen and Respond**: Practice active listening by having the audience ask one simple question after each presentation: "What was your favorite part?" This teaches children that good communication is two-way.

5. **Real-World Practice**: Point out presenters in daily life: "That person on TV is a presenter—see how they're speaking to us?" Help children recognize public speaking in everyday contexts.
