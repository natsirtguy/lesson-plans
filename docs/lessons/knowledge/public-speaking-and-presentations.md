# PUBLIC SPEAKING AND PRESENTATIONS

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces children to the confidence and joy of sharing their thoughts, ideas, and creative works with others. Through playful "show and tell" experiences and a safe practice environment with familiar adults, children develop early communication skills, build self-confidence, and learn that their voice and ideas matter.

## Vocabulary

**Audience**: The group of people who are listening to you or watching what you do. When you sing a song for your family, your family is your audience.

**Present**: To show something or share it with others. When you present a picture you drew, you hold it up and tell people about it.

**Confidence**: A feeling of being brave and sure about yourself. When you feel confident, you believe you can do something well, even if it feels a little scary.

**Expression**: Showing your feelings and ideas using your face, voice, and body. A big smile is an expression that shows you're happy, and your words are expressions of what you're thinking.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children practice sharing a special object or creation with a small, supportive audience (you!). This hands-on experience builds public speaking confidence in a low-pressure environment where mistakes are celebrated as learning. Through repetition and gentle encouragement, children develop the courage to use their voice and discover that sharing makes others happy.

**Activity Type**: Demonstration and practice with immediate positive feedback

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- 2-3 special objects the child can talk about (favorite toy, stuffed animal, book, picture they drew)
- A simple "stage" area (a chair, blanket laid out, or small carpet square to mark the space)
- A mirror (helps children see their own confident expression)

**Optional**:
- Toy microphone (paper towel tube decorated with stickers)
- Small props for pretend presenting (pointer stick, clipboard)
- Stuffed animal "audience" to make it feel less intimidating
- Picture cards showing different feelings/expressions

**Cost**: Free (using items you have at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose a comfortable, familiar space with minimal distractions
2. Set up your "stage" area by laying down a blanket or clearing a small space
3. Arrange 2-3 objects nearby that the child might want to talk about
4. Sit at child's eye level or slightly lower so you're not looming above them
5. Safety check: ensure the space is clear of tripping hazards

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Start by modeling confidence yourself. Say: "Watch me! I'm going to tell you about my favorite thing." Hold up an object and speak clearly about it: "This is my watch. It tells me the time. I like it because it's shiny and goes tick-tick-tick." Smile big and gesture with your hands. Invite the child: "Now it's your turn to be the presenter! You can pick something you want to tell me about."

2. **Exploration** (8-12 min):
   Let the child choose an object or creation. Give them time to think. Ask gentle prompts: "What is it?" "Why do you like it?" "What color is it?" "How does it feel?" Encourage them to stand in the "stage" area, even if briefly. Allow them to hold the object while speaking. Listen intently, make eye contact, smile, and nod. Celebrate their effort with genuine praise: "You spoke so clearly!" "I loved hearing about that!"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Ask follow-up questions that help them expand their thinking: "Can you show us how it works?" "How did you make that?" "What's your favorite part?" Point out their strengths: "You used such a loud, clear voice!" "You looked at me while you were talking—that's great eye contact!" Let them present multiple objects if they're enjoying it. Some children may repeat the same object over and over—this is wonderful practice and should be celebrated each time.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Give a big round of applause or cheer. Say: "You were such an amazing presenter! You shared your ideas with me and I felt so happy listening. You were brave and confident!" Consider making this a tradition: "We can do this again tomorrow if you'd like!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep it very simple and short. The child might just hold up an object or say one word ("Bear!"). Don't expect full sentences. Accept pointing, single words, or even just standing in the "stage" area as successful presenting. Focus entirely on celebrating their courage. Use more prompting and leading questions. You might do most of the talking while they listen and contribute what they can.

**3-4+ years**:
Invite longer explanations and more details. Ask "why" and "how" questions to encourage thinking beyond simple description. Introduce the idea of an "audience"—invite a stuffed animal to watch, then talk about how the stuffed animal is listening and enjoying the presentation. Encourage them to look at you (or the stuffed animal) while speaking. Challenge them to present without holding the object, just describing it. Play "switch roles"—you be the audience member and ask questions while they answer as the presenter.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Picture Walk Presentation**: Instead of showing objects, have the child look through a picture book and choose one page to "present" to you. They describe what they see and tell you a story about the picture.

**Variation 2 - Creation Showcase**: After art projects, building activities, or playdough creations, make a special "showcase time" where the child presents their work. Take photos of their creation so they can present it again later and remember their presentation.

**Repeat play**: Make this a daily ritual—"Presentation Practice Time"—even if just for 2-3 minutes. Repetition builds confidence dramatically. Children who present the same object five days in a row will show noticeable growth in comfort and enthusiasm by day five.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is very shy or nervous and doesn't want to present.
**Solution**: Don't force it. Start by having them present to just you, or even to a stuffed animal while you listen nearby. You can also present first and let them simply hold the object while you talk. Over time, with repeated exposure in a completely pressure-free environment, confidence grows naturally. Some children need more time than others—this is developmentally normal.

**Challenge**: Child repeats the same sentence over and over ("It's my toy. It's my toy.").
**Solution**: This is actually wonderful! They're practicing the same skill repeatedly, which is how young brains learn best. You can gently expand by asking a new question each time ("What color is it? What shape is it? How does it feel?"), but always celebrate their effort the same way.

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated or quits after one attempt.
**Solution**: Keep the activity very short and end on a positive note. One successful presentation is a win! Don't push for more. Praise heavily and try again the next day. Building a positive association with presenting is more important than quantity.

**Challenge**: Child mumbles or speaks too quietly.
**Solution**: Model speaking clearly and loudly yourself first. You can playfully say, "I couldn't hear you! Can you use your big, loud voice again?" Make it a fun game rather than criticism. Sometimes children speak more clearly when they're looking at you or when there's a "pretend microphone."

### Follow-Up Activities
1. **Create a "Presentation Certificate"**: Draw or print a simple certificate saying your child is a "Great Presenter!" and display it. This builds pride in their accomplishment and reminds them of their capability.

2. **Photo Memory Wall**: Take pictures of your child presenting and display them on a wall. Talk about the photo: "Remember when you presented your dinosaur? You spoke so clearly!" This reinforces the positive memory and encourages future presentations.

3. **Daily Life Connection**: Point out presenters in your child's world. "Look, the teacher is presenting the lesson to the class." "The store clerk is presenting the menu to us." Help your child notice that everyone speaks and shares, and it's a normal, happy part of life.
