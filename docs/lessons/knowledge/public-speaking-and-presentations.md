# Arts & Culture Activity: Public speaking and presentations

## Activity Summary

Public speaking and presentations for young children introduces the foundational skills of verbal communication, confidence building, and sharing ideas with others in a supportive environment. Through simple show-and-tell activities, group sharing circles, and guided storytelling, children develop the ability to express themselves clearly, make eye contact, and engage an audience—all at an age-appropriate level. This activity builds self-confidence, expands vocabulary, encourages listening skills, and helps children feel comfortable being the center of attention in safe, encouraging settings.

**Activity Type**: Communication, Social and Cultural Practice, Creative Expression

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Mess Level**: Low - Minimal materials involved, mostly verbal activity

**Best Environment**: Large open area with group seating, circle time space, or quiet room where all children can see and hear each other

## Complete Activity Setup

### Materials Needed

**Essential materials**:
- Comfortable seating for a circle or small group (cushions, chairs, or floor mats) - for all participants
- Simple props or objects children can share (stuffed animals, picture books, toys, natural items) - 3-5 items for demonstration
- A simple podium or elevated space (optional chair or small step stool) - for visual focus
- Picture cards or props for storytelling (colorful images, felt board materials) - 5-10 items

**Optional enhancements**:
- Microphone (toy or real) - adds excitement and helps shy children project their voice
- Simple costume pieces or hats - encourages character play and engagement
- Poster with simple "speaking tips" (smile, look at friends, use a big voice) - visual reminders with pictures
- Decorations for a "stage" area - creates special atmosphere with drapes, string lights, or colored tape
- Sound effects materials (bells, drums, shakers) - adds multisensory engagement
- Video recording device - allows children to see themselves speaking (powerful learning tool)

**Cost estimate**: Free - Under $5 (using household items; optional props may add $5-20)

**Preparation time**: 5-10 minutes (arrange seating, gather simple props)

### Step-by-Step Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Arrange seating in a circle or semicircle so all children can see and hear each other comfortably
2. Clear the center space of hazards and distractions—this is the "presentation area"
3. Gather and place 3-5 simple objects or props nearby that children can use for their presentations
4. Test any audio equipment (microphone, speakers) if using

**Environment setup**:
- Arrange seating at child eye level (on floor or low chairs) to create an intimate, non-threatening atmosphere
- Create a designated "speaker's spot" in the center—mark it with a carpet square, cushion, or tape if helpful
- Position yourself where all children can see you, and where you're at eye level when sitting with the group
- Ensure good lighting and minimal background noise
- If recording, position camera/device to capture the speaker's face and voice clearly

**Cleaning supplies ready**:
- Simple wipes for any props used
- Hand sanitizer if sharing objects

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Sit in the circle with the children and explain in simple, excited language: "Today, we're going to practice being speakers! We get to share stories, ideas, and things we love with our friends!"
- Show enthusiasm and model what you mean: "When we're speakers, we can tell our friends about something that makes us happy, or show them something cool."
- Demonstrate the "speaker's spot": Point to the center space and show how speakers stand or sit there so everyone can see and hear them
- Use a warm, encouraging tone that conveys this is a safe, fun space—not a test or performance

**Setting expectations**:
- Simple guideline: "When someone is speaking, our friends listen. We use our ears and eyes to show we care."
- Another guideline: "There's no 'right way' to speak. We just share what we think or feel, and that makes us great speakers!"
- Emphasize process over perfection: "What matters is trying and having fun. Everyone's voice is important here."
- Offer reassurance: "If you feel shy, that's okay! You can speak softly, or you can just smile at us."

### Main Activity (10-20 minutes)

**Phase 1: Modeling and Exploration** (3-5 minutes)
You model what a "presentation" looks like for this age:
- Stand/sit in the speaker's spot with a simple object (stuffed animal, book, toy)
- Hold it up and share something brief: "This is my teddy bear. I love hugging it. It makes me feel cozy."
- Make eye contact with several children, smile, and show genuine joy about what you're sharing
- Use your voice expressively but naturally—not overly theatrical
- Keep it short (30-60 seconds) and simple so children understand the format
- Observe children's reactions and comment on what makes good listening: "I see everyone looking at me and listening. That makes me feel so happy!"

**Phase 2: Guided Practice** (5-10 minutes)
Children take turns as speakers with your support:
- Invite 1-2 children at a time to come to the speaker's spot (offer choice: "Would you like to share something with us?")
- For shy or hesitant children, offer support: "You can hold this toy and tell us about it," or "Tell us what color you like"
- Ask open-ended prompts if they need help: "What do you like about that?" "How does it make you feel?" "What would you do with it?"
- Ensure all children are listening—position yourself to model attentive listening (eye contact, nodding, smiling)
- After each child shares, lead simple applause or celebration: "Great job sharing! Everyone heard your wonderful ideas!"
- Keep each turn brief (under 1 minute for very young children, 1-2 minutes for older ones)

**Phase 3: Free Expression** (remaining time)
Open the floor for more children to volunteer:
- Ask: "Who else would like to share something with our group?"
- Accept all offerings without judgment—whether children share words, show a toy, point, sing, or make sounds
- For children who don't want to speak, offer alternatives: "Would you like to stand here with me while I tell about you?" (co-presenting)
- Celebrate each attempt: "Thank you for sharing! You were so brave!"
- If a child repeats another's turn, allow it—repetition is important for language development

**Adult role**:
- Be the biggest cheerleader and model listener—your enthusiasm is contagious
- Provide prompts and support without taking over the child's turn
- Ask follow-up questions that help children expand their ideas naturally: "And then what?" "How did that feel?"
- Step back from the speaker's spot once you've modeled; let children be the focus
- Use natural, encouraging language—avoid overly correcting speech or grammar
- Note struggling speakers and plan individual support or practice

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Gather everyone back in the circle
- Acknowledge the effort: "You were all wonderful speakers today! I was so proud listening to all of you!"
- Reflection question: "What was your favorite part? What did you like hearing about from your friends?" (Take 2-3 responses)
- Optional: "How did it feel to be a speaker? Raise your hand if it felt fun!" (Normalize that it's okay to feel nervous too)

**Transition to cleanup**:
- Explain that sharing and speaking together is one kind of "work" we do: "Being a good speaker and a good listener is very important!"
- Ask children to help gather any props: "Let's help put our special things away together"
- Make cleanup part of the learning: "Working together is another kind of teamwork, just like being good speakers!"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Approach**:
- Expect very brief verbal contributions (single words, short phrases, or sounds)
- Focus heavily on modeling and creating a comfortable, pressure-free environment
- Use lots of visual support (holding up objects, pointing, using gestures)
- Keep the group very small (2-4 children) to reduce overwhelm
- Accept nonverbal sharing (pointing, nodding, making sounds)
- Structure the activity with concrete, immediate rewards (singing, clapping right away)

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes total (shorter attention span)

**Adult support**: High level of support needed—you'll do most of the talking, with children contributing single words or sounds; this is normal and important for language development at this age

### 3-4+ years
**Extensions**:
- Encourage fuller sentences and multiple ideas: "Tell us more about that! What happened next?"
- Introduce simple props that spark storytelling: "This teddy wants to tell us about a picnic. What did it eat?"
- Add simple interactive elements: Ask the audience follow-up questions about what was shared
- Support children in describing feelings and reasons: "How did that make you feel? Why was that special?"
- Offer options for different types of presentations: Show-and-tell, singing a song, telling a joke, demonstrating an action
- Introduce the idea of audience participation: "Can everyone make the sound the animal made?"

**Duration**: They may engage longer—allow 20-30 minutes as interest holds

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Story Circle**
Instead of individual presentations, sit together and create a collaborative story. One child starts with a sentence or idea, and the next child adds to it. Record it and play it back. Emphasizes listening, building on others' ideas, and speaking as part of a group.

**Variation 2: Puppet Presentations**
Provide simple puppets or have children make puppets from socks or paper bags. Children can present their ideas "through" the puppet, which reduces self-consciousness and encourages more elaborate speaking. The puppet becomes the speaker—a powerful tool for shy children.

**Variation 3: Sing and Share**
Children present their ideas through song, chant, or rhythmic speech. Sing a familiar tune and have them share information: "I like ___, I like ___, I like ___ today!" This adds a musical, less formal element and appeals to kinesthetic learners.

**Variation 4: Photo Presentations**
Gather photos of children's families, favorite places, or activities. Children present their photo: "This is my grandma. She likes to bake cookies." Connects speaking to personal, meaningful content and builds family connections.

**Variation 5: Talent Showcase**
Shift from "show-and-tell" to "show-what-you-can-do." Children demonstrate a skill (jumping, singing a song, doing a silly dance, making animal sounds). Celebrates diverse abilities and reduces pressure to have "something to show."

**Thematic variations**:
- Seasonal presentations (favorite fall activity, winter clothing, spring flower, summer fun)
- Holiday-based sharing (what's special about your family celebration)
- Interest-based (pets, transportation, foods, animals, colors)
- Adventures (places we've been, things we've seen, friends we've made)

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Public speaking and presentations are fundamental human practices found across all cultures. From oral storytelling traditions (ancient campfires, African griots, Indigenous oral histories) to modern conferences and performances, humans have always shared information, stories, and ideas with groups. In early childhood, this activity honors the child's emerging voice and validates that what they think and feel matters—a core principle in respectful, inclusive education. Different cultures emphasize different aspects: some cultures value eloquence and detailed storytelling; others value group consensus and collective speaking. All recognize that being heard and listened to is essential to human dignity and learning.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Highlight different speaking traditions: "In some families, storytelling is very important. Grandparents tell stories to grandchildren. What stories does your family tell?"
- Celebrate different languages and accents: Invite family members who speak different languages to share words, stories, or songs
- Explore different types of presentations: Show pictures or brief videos of different cultural performances (Indian classical music recitation, African call-and-response traditions, Japanese poetry sharing, Indigenous story circles)
- Include diverse speakers in your modeling: If possible, involve fathers, grandfathers, male caregivers, and people of different backgrounds in presentations so children see varied examples
- Create a "world speakers" theme where you introduce simple presentations from different cultures each week

**Books/Media**:
- "The Lion and the Mouse" (Aesop's Fables retold in many versions)—a classic story about communication and relationships
- "Pete the Cat" by James Dean—features a confident, expressive character with a positive attitude
- "Corduroy" by Don Freeman—a character with a gentle voice and important things to say
- Video: Search for "children's storytelling circles" or "diverse oral traditions for kids" online—many libraries have curated collections

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: A child is very shy and refuses to speak in front of the group, or only whispers
**Why**: Many children naturally experience shyness or social anxiety, especially when being the center of attention. This is developmentally normal and doesn't indicate a problem. Forcing a shy child to perform often increases anxiety and can create negative associations with speaking.
**Solution**: Never force participation. Instead, offer low-pressure alternatives: (1) Let them sit close to you while you present "their" idea; (2) Have them speak into a toy microphone to a stuffed animal first, privately; (3) Start with 1-on-1 speaking practice before group; (4) Use puppets or props to speak through; (5) Allow them to listen and participate through actions (clapping, nodding). Praise their willingness to be present. Shyness often decreases naturally with age and repeated positive exposure.

**Challenge**: Children don't listen to each other; they talk over one another or seem disengaged when peers speak
**Why**: Young children are highly egocentric developmentally and are still learning the social skill of listening. They may not yet understand that everyone gets a turn, or they may become distracted by their own desire to speak next.
**Solution**: Model attentive listening intensely—make it obvious that you're listening with your body (facing the speaker, eyes on them, nodding). Explicitly teach listening: "My ears are listening. My eyes are looking. My mouth is quiet." Use a talking stick or object that only the speaker holds—others cannot speak without it. Create a visible "waiting list" (pictures of children) so others know it's their turn coming. Celebrate good listening as much as good speaking.

**Challenge**: One child dominates, repeatedly volunteering and talking for long periods; other children don't get turns
**Why**: Some children are naturally more extroverted or have more practice speaking; they may not realize others want turns. They might also be seeking attention or using talking as a comfort strategy.
**Solution**: Set a kind, consistent limit: "I love your ideas! Each person gets one turn so everyone can share. Your turn is coming around again soon." Use a timer or song to gently signal when time is up. Specifically invite quieter children to speak: "I'd love to hear from [name]." Consider having individual turns rather than an open circle so everyone is guaranteed a space. Balance group time with 1-on-1 speaking practice.

**Challenge**: A child becomes upset or distressed if they "mess up" their words, cry easily, or show frustration
**Why**: Young children are still developing emotional regulation and may not yet separate mistakes from self-worth. They may be experiencing performance anxiety or perfectionism modeled by caregivers.
**Solution**: Immediately normalize mistakes and emotion: "Everyone's brain gets mixed up with words sometimes—that's how we learn! Your idea was great." Model your own mistakes and laugh: "I said that all wrong! Let me try again." Emphasize that trying is success: "You were so brave to get up there. I'm proud of you!" Avoid praise focused on perfection ("You said it perfectly!") and instead praise effort ("You really tried hard to tell us about that!"). In private, comfort the child and explain that feelings are okay.

### Tips for Success
- **Start small and celebrate everything**: Begin with just 2-3 children presenting, not the whole group. Celebrate every attempt—whispers, gestures, single words all count as successful speaking
- **Make it about connection, not performance**: Emphasize that the point is for friends to learn about each other, not to be "good" at speaking. Children should feel they're sharing, not auditioning
- **Practice 1-on-1 first**: Before group presentations, have one-on-one conversations with each child about what they might share. This builds confidence and gives them practice in a safe space
- **Use props and visuals heavily**: Objects, pictures, and actions reduce the pressure to have perfect words. A child holding a toy has something to do with their nervous hands and a natural focal point for talking
- **Record and replay**: Video or audio recording children speaking and playing it back is powerful. Children love hearing themselves, and it's a concrete reminder of their accomplishment
- **Vary the format constantly**: Change whether children sit or stand, speak into a microphone, present to the whole group or small group, use props or not. Variety keeps it fresh and lets different children shine in different formats
- **Connect to real life**: "When you grow up, you might need to share ideas in class, or tell people about your job, or teach someone something you know. We're practicing that now!"

### What to Do With the Creation
- **Celebrate and display**: If you've recorded children presenting, save clips and share with families (with permission). Families love seeing their child speaking confidently!
- **Create a "Speaker of the Week" feature**: Display a photo or drawing of the child who presented, along with what they shared. Celebrate them on a bulletin board or through a newsletter
- **Document in a journal**: Keep notes on what each child shared and how they did it. This becomes a wonderful record of their emerging communication skills and growing confidence
- **Make it repeatable**: This activity isn't a "one-time" thing—it should be a regular feature (weekly circle time, monthly presentations). Children build confidence through repetition and knowing they'll get another chance
- **Transition to independence**: As children get older, encourage them to present to different audiences (other classrooms, parents, siblings). Each new audience builds their public speaking skills
