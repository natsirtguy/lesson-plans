# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Real Estate and House Buying Play

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Children explore homes, properties, buying, selling, and community through imaginative role-play as buyers, sellers, real estate agents, or homeowners. They negotiate purchases, design home spaces, and learn about ownership, value, and commerce in age-appropriate ways. This activity builds early economic understanding, develops negotiation and communication skills, and fosters spatial reasoning while helping children understand the adult world of homes and transactions.

## Vocabulary

**Property**: A house or piece of land that someone owns. Property has value — it can be bought, sold, rented, or left to family. Land itself has value even without a building on it.

**Appraise / Market value**: To estimate what a property is worth based on evidence — its size, features, condition, location, and what similar properties recently sold for. Two identical houses can have very different market values based purely on location.

**Mortgage**: A loan from a bank to buy a house. Most people can't pay for a house all at once, so a bank lends them most of the money. The buyer pays the bank back in monthly payments over 15-30 years, plus extra called interest — a fee for using the bank's money.

**Equity**: The portion of the house you actually own. If a house costs $300,000 and you borrowed $270,000 from the bank, you have $30,000 of equity (10%). Each mortgage payment slowly increases your equity — you own more and owe less.

**Interest rate**: The percentage the bank charges for lending money. A higher interest rate means you pay more total for the same house. A 3% interest rate is much cheaper than a 7% interest rate over 30 years.

**Supply and demand**: When many people want houses in an area but few are available (low supply, high demand), prices rise. When few people want houses but many are available (high supply, low demand), prices fall. Location drives real estate value more than almost anything else.

**Negotiate**: To discuss and reach an agreement. In real estate, buyers often offer less than the asking price, sellers may counter-offer, and both parties negotiate until they agree — or walk away.

**Broker / Real estate agent**: A licensed professional who helps buyers find and purchase properties, and helps sellers market and sell them. Agents earn a commission — typically 5-6% of the sale price.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

In this role-playing activity, children explore real estate and home buying through imaginative play. They examine toy houses or pictures, take on roles as buyers, sellers, or agents, and negotiate imaginary property purchases. This develops economic thinking, communication skills, and spatial reasoning while helping them understand how adults make decisions about homes and property.

**Activity Type**: Role-playing and simulation

**Duration**: 20-40 minutes

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Toy houses, dollhouses, or building blocks
- Play money (paper bills, coins, or homemade currency)
- Pictures of real houses (from magazines, printouts, or family photos)
- Paper for price tags, signs, and simple contracts
- Markers or crayons for labeling and decorating

**Optional**:
- Toy furniture to furnish the houses
- Real estate agent props (clipboards, briefcases)
- Camera or phone for documenting open houses
- Toy vehicles for families to arrive in
- Building materials (blocks, cardboard boxes, fabric)
- Large paper for drawing a neighborhood map
- Home design materials (fabric swatches, paint samples)

**Cost**: Free to $10

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all toy houses, blocks, pictures, and reference materials
2. Create play money (print currency images or draw simple coins and bills)
3. Make price tags and "For Sale" signs on paper
4. Set up zones: designing area (table), building area (open floor), real estate office (corner)
5. Arrange all materials at child height for easy access
6. Have cleanup supplies ready (paper towels, container for blocks, trash bin)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Show two toy houses or pictures. Ask: "Why do you think one house might cost more than another?"

   Explain: "Houses have different prices because of supply and demand, and features. A house near a park, in a popular neighborhood, with lots of rooms costs more because many families want it and there aren't many like it. That's supply and demand."

   Introduce the mortgage concept: "Most people can't pay for a whole house at once — a big house might cost $400,000! So they borrow most of the money from a bank. That loan is called a **mortgage**. They pay the bank back slowly, every month, for 30 years — plus extra called **interest**, which is the bank's fee for lending the money."

   "Today we're pretend buyers, sellers, and agents — let's see if we can figure out what makes our toy houses worth more or less!"

2. **Exploration** (4-6 minutes):
   Let the child explore toy houses or pictures. Ask: "Which house do you like best? What rooms does it have? What makes a house special?" Introduce the concept that sellers want to sell houses, buyers want to buy them, and agents help them meet.

3. **Guided Role-Play** (6-15 minutes):
   Model different roles. As a seller/agent, **appraise** the house: "This house has 3 bedrooms, a yard, and is near the pretend park. I think it's worth $250,000 because similar houses nearby sold for that." As a buyer: "That's a lot! I only have $50,000 saved. I'll need a mortgage for $200,000. At 5% interest rate, my monthly payment will be high — can you lower the price?"

   Model negotiation: Seller comes down to $240,000; buyer accepts. "You just negotiated! The seller got less than they wanted, but the buyer paid more than they hoped — that's how real deals work."

   Ask genuinely: "If we add a swimming pool to this house, does it become worth more? What about if a noisy factory opened next door — would that make it worth more or less? Why?"

4. **Independent Play** (remaining time):
   Let the child play freely, negotiating prices, designing homes, and creating their own scenarios. If multiple children are playing, they negotiate with each other. Comment on their thinking: "You raised the price because the house has a pool—that's smart!"

5. **Wrap-Up** (2-3 minutes):
   Acknowledge the play: "You were amazing real estate agents and buyers today!" Ask reflection questions: "Which house did you like best? What was your favorite part?" Help organize and clean up together.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on exploring houses and naming rooms (bedroom, kitchen, bathroom). Keep roles very simple: "You have a house" and "Pick your favorite room." Use concrete toy houses, not pictures. Keep sessions to 15-20 minutes. Model all actions and provide lots of help with language. Use simple words: "This is a house," "You live here," "It has a kitchen."

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce more complex scenarios like comparing multiple properties and designing dream homes. Add problem-solving: "This house doesn't have a garage—can we add one?" Create stories: "This family needs a big house because they have five children." Gently introduce economics: "Bigger houses cost more money." Build entire neighborhoods with multiple properties. Design homes with real materials like paint chips and fabric samples. Introduce negotiation challenges and business concepts like creating a real estate office with listings and sales logs.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Design a neighborhood with multiple houses, a park, a school, and stores. Child plans where everyone lives and how the community works.

**Variation 2**: Give design challenges: "Design a house for a family with three kids" or "Create a house perfect for someone who loves gardening." Child problem-solves and explains design choices.

**Variation 3**: Set up a formal real estate agency where the child is the agent. Create property listings, take client appointments, show homes, and keep a sales ledger.

**Variation 4**: Explore different types of homes (beach house, mountain cabin, desert home) or homes from different cultures and time periods.

**Repeat play**: Vary the scenario each time (neighborhood building, dream home design, real estate business). Save designs and recreate or expand them on future days.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child focuses only on accumulating houses or sets unrealistic prices (one penny or one million dollars).

**Solution**: Young children are still developing fairness and value concepts. Gently guide thinking: "Is that price fair for both people? Does the seller feel happy?" Use questions to build intuition about value. Let them experiment—understanding develops over time with exposure.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't engage with buying/selling; just wants to play with houses as regular toys.

**Solution**: That's fine! Adjust to match their interests. Focus on design, decoration, and storytelling instead of transactions. The play is still valuable—they're learning about spaces and homes.

**Challenge**: Multiple children want the same property, causing conflict.

**Solution**: This is a valuable learning opportunity for negotiation and compromise. Help them problem-solve: "You both want this house. Could one person wait? Could you trade? Could you build another like it?" Model fair conflict resolution.

**Challenge**: Child confuses pretend with reality; asks if they're actually buying a house.

**Solution**: Gently clarify without dismissing their thinking: "We're playing pretend with pretend money. Real houses are where real families live. In our game, we get to imagine buying and selling houses."

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Real-world connection**: Point out "For Sale" signs on actual houses, talk about when your family moved, or discuss house hunting experiences to make the play relevant.

2. **Building on learning**: Explore different types of homes (apartments, mobile homes, houseboats). Show pictures of homes from different cultures and climates to expand their understanding of how people live.

3. **Extending the story**: Create narratives around the houses: "This family just moved in," "That house is 100 years old," "Someone is moving away"—this contextualizes and deepens the play.
