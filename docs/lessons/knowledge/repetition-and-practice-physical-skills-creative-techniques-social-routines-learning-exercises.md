# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Repetition and Practice

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces children to the powerful concept that improvement comes through repetition and sustained practice. Through multi-domain practice stations, children will experience directly how doing something multiple times helps them get better, whether they're learning physical movements, refining creative techniques, mastering social routines, or solving learning challenges. They'll discover that practice is how we all grow and become more skilled.

## Vocabulary

**Repetition**: Doing the same thing over and over again to become better at it. Like practicing your jump, painting circles, or singing your favorite song many times until it feels easier and smoother.

**Persistence**: Continuing to try and keep going even when something feels hard or you want to stop. Showing persistence means practicing your dance moves again and again, or building your block tower even when it falls down.

**Progression**: Getting a little bit better each time you practice, step by step, creating improvement over time. Like going from scribbling randomly to making shapes, or from a small jump to a bigger jump.

**Mastery**: Becoming so skilled at something that you can do it easily and confidently without having to think very hard. When you can dance smoothly, build blocks steadily, or paint shapes clearly because you've practiced so much.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 6 lines each):

*Verse 1*
Practice, practice, every day
Helps us learn and grow and play
Try again if you fall down
You can do it all around
Practice, practice, every day
That's the best and finest way

*Verse 2*
Stretch your arms and touch your toes
Paint a picture as it grows
Sing a song and dance around
Make a wonderful new sound
Every time you try and try
You can reach up to the sky

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Clap hands together repeatedly to the beat during "practice, practice" lines
2. Bounce or jump gently up and down when singing about trying again and dancing
3. Reach arms up high toward the sky at the end, showing growth and reaching goals

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will visit 3-4 practice stations, spending time at each one repeating a simple skill or technique. At each station, they'll notice themselves improving slightly with each attempt. This hands-on exploration teaches that practice genuinely works and that improvement happens gradually—not suddenly. The variety of stations (physical movement, creative creation, building, social routines) demonstrates that practice applies everywhere in life.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on practice stations and experiential learning

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper and crayons or markers (for drawing practice station)
- Blocks, stacking cups, or similar building materials (for building practice)
- Open space or music for movement practice
- Quiet space or props for social routine practice

**Optional**:
- Mirror or reflective surface (so child can observe their own movement)
- Simple progress chart or stickers (to mark practice attempts)
- Camera or phone for photo documentation
- Props like scarves, ribbons, or balls for movement variation

**Cost**: Free to $5 (using household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Set up 3-4 distinct practice stations in your space, each with clear materials and purpose
2. Ensure all materials are safe, clean, and accessible to the child
3. Clear the area of hazards and distractions
4. Have a quiet place to gather for introduction and reflection

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Gather together and explain with enthusiasm: "Today we're going to practice! When we practice, we do something again and again, and our brain learns better and better each time!" Show one quick example—like clapping a simple rhythm or drawing a shape—and do it three times. Say: "See? First time, second time, third time. That's practicing!"

2. **Exploration** (10-15 min):
   Guide your child through each station. Spend 2-3 minutes at each:

   **Station 1 - Drawing Practice**: Invite your child to draw one simple shape (circle, line, scribble pattern) repeatedly on paper. Say: "Let's make many circles! How many can you make?" Watch each attempt and comment: "There's one! Here's another! Look at this one!" Focus on the repetition, not on how they look.

   **Station 2 - Building Practice**: Offer blocks or stacking cups. Challenge them to stack repeatedly. Say: "Build it up! Now let's knock it down and build again." Celebrate each attempt: "You tried again! That's practicing!" Notice if their stacks get slightly steadier with repetition.

   **Station 3 - Movement Practice**: Play music or create a simple rhythm. Invite them to repeat a movement (jumping, spinning, reaching, marching) over and over. Participate alongside them. Say: "Jump, jump, jump! One more time! Again!" Notice and name any improvements in balance or confidence.

   **Optional Station 4 - Routine Practice**: Practice a simple social routine like greeting someone, asking for something politely, or taking turns. Repeat it 5-8 times. Say: "Let's say hello again! And again!" Show how repetition makes it feel more natural.

3. **Discovery** (2-3 min):
   Come back together and reflect on what happened: "You practiced drawing circles SO many times! You practiced jumping again and again! What did you notice?" Ask: "Was your second time different from your first time? Your third time?" Help them see: "You're getting better each time you practice!"

4. **Wrap-up** (1-2 min):
   Celebrate with genuine excitement: "Today you showed me what practicing looks like—doing something many times and getting better!" Sing a quick verse of your practice song. Say: "Every single time you try, your brain is learning. I'm so proud of you for practicing!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep stations extremely simple with one clear action per station. Offer very repetitive, concrete activities (stacking one block over and over, drawing one scribble pattern, bouncing in place, waving repeatedly). Use short, simple language: "Stack! Stack! Stack!" Keep practice sessions to 10-12 minutes total. Provide lots of hand-over-hand support if needed. Emphasize the joy and pleasure of repetition rather than improvement. Repeat the same activity across multiple days rather than many times in one session.

**3-4+ years**:
Add slightly more complexity to stations (draw different shapes, build taller structures, create a movement sequence, practice more complex routines). Point out specific improvements: "Your stack is taller this time!" or "That jump was higher!" Introduce simple goals: "Let's try 10 jumps" and celebrate reaching the goal. Ask reflective questions: "What was different this time?" Extend station time to 3-4 minutes. Involve them in deciding what to practice next.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Create a Practice Chart - After the activity, draw or print 10 boxes on paper. Explain: "Each time you practice this week, we'll fill in one box." Let the child put a sticker or make a mark in a box daily for the same practice activity. This shows visible, cumulative progress.

**Variation 2**: Practice and Progress Photos - Take a photo of one attempt at the beginning, middle, and end of a week-long practice cycle. Display the three photos side by side to show tangible improvement. Children love seeing visual proof of their progress.

**Repeat play**: Rotate the stations and skills you practice, or return to favorites. Children benefit enormously from practicing the same skill multiple times over weeks. They'll see their own improvement directly, which builds confidence and motivation.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child says "I don't want to do it again" or "I'm tired of practicing."

**Solution**: Reframe the activity away from the word "practice"—call it "let's play" or "let's try this together." Add variations so each repetition feels slightly different (different colors, different sizes, different locations, different speeds). Mix practice with free play. Most importantly, follow their interest—never force practice. Instead, celebrate when they naturally repeat: "You did that three times! That's practicing!"

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated when attempts don't look "right" or when they fall/fail.

**Solution**: This is crucial for learning! Reframe frustration as part of the process. Stay calm and matter-of-fact: "Oh, it fell. That's what happens when we're learning!" Avoid perfectionism language. Celebrate the attempt and trying again, not the result. Use language like "not yet": "You can't stack five blocks yet, but you're learning!" Model practicing and making mistakes yourself cheerfully.

**Challenge**: Child practices once or twice and loses interest, refuses to repeat.

**Solution**: Add novelty while keeping the same skill (use different colors, try different speeds, practice in a different location, try with a friend). Embed practice in meaningful play: "Let's practice our painting to make decorations for the party" is more motivating than "let's practice painting." If the skill is too easy, add challenge. If too hard, break it into smaller steps. Some children are naturally less repetition-focused—that's okay. You can still celebrate when they do repeat.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Practice Routine**: Pick one simple skill to practice together each day for a week (hopping, drawing circles, greeting each other). Track progress visually. Children learn that practice is a regular, valuable part of life.

2. **Notice Practice Everywhere**: Throughout your day, point out when people practice: "Look, that person is running—they practice to get so fast!" Help your child recognize real-world examples of practice paying off.

3. **Celebrate Small Improvements**: When you notice your child getting better at everyday skills (climbing stairs more confidently, holding a crayon more steadily, asking permission more often), explicitly connect it to practice: "You've been doing that a lot lately, and you're so much better at it now!"
