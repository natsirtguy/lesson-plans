# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Research Project Games

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Research Project Games introduce young learners to the joy of discovery and investigation through playful, hands-on exploration. Children collect items, sort information, and ask questions about their world while developing early research skills and observation abilities. This activity builds curiosity, scientific thinking, and deeper understanding of how we can learn about objects and our environment.

## Vocabulary

**Investigate**: To examine something carefully and in detail to discover facts, details, or answers to your questions. When you investigate a seashell, you look closely, feel it, and ask questions about where it came from.

**Observe**: To watch and notice what is happening around you using all your senses. When you observe a leaf, you notice its color, texture, shape, and how it moves in the wind.

**Categorize**: To sort or organize things into groups based on what they have in common. When you categorize buttons, you might put all the red ones together, or all the round ones together.

**Hypothesis**: An idea or guess about what might happen before you test or discover the answer. Your hypothesis might be "I think this rock came from the beach" or "I think this tool is used for cutting."

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
We can all be little scientists, E-I-E-I-O
And we'll investigate and explore, E-I-E-I-O
With a look and touch here, and a sort and find there
Here a look, there a touch, everywhere a discovery
We can all be little scientists, E-I-E-I-O

*Verse 2*
We can ask our questions, what and why, E-I-E-I-O
As we gather clues to help us try, E-I-E-I-O
With a count and compare here, and a group things there
Here a count, there a group, everywhere we're learning
We can ask our questions, what and why, E-I-E-I-O

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Touch something and look closely at it (investigate gesture)
2. Sort items by putting similar ones together (grouping motion)
3. Point and ask "What's that?" with a curious expression (wondering gesture)

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children engage in hands-on exploration of a collection of interesting items, learning to observe carefully, ask questions, and organize information. Through guided investigation—sorting, comparing, describing, and documenting—children develop foundational research skills and discover that learning happens through careful attention and curiosity.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration, hands-on discovery play, guided investigation

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Collection of 10-15 interesting items (natural objects, household items, or themed collection)
- Magnifying glass or hand lens
- Paper, markers, or colored pencils for recording observations
- Containers or baskets for sorting items
- Clipboard or hard surface for documentation

**Optional**:
- Camera or tablet for photographing discoveries
- Chart paper for group documentation
- Picture cards or symbols to label categories
- Natural objects (leaves, rocks, twigs, shells, acorns)
- Small containers with mysterious contents

**Cost**: Free to Under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather 10-15 safe, non-toxic, age-appropriate items (avoid small choking hazards for younger children)
2. Arrange items on a table or display area where the child can easily see and access them
3. Test magnifying glass and materials for safety
4. Prepare paper, markers, and sorting containers within reach
5. Ensure good lighting and a clear flat workspace
6. Have cleanup supplies ready (damp cloth, small trash bin)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (3-5 min):
   Show genuine excitement about the collection: "I found some really interesting things I want to explore with you today!" Let the child handle a mystery container or covered collection to build anticipation. Use simple language: "We're going to be explorers and discover things about these items." Emphasize that there are no right answers—we're just looking and wondering together.

2. **Exploration** (5-7 min):
   The child freely handles, examines, and explores each item without direction. Encourage multi-sensory exploration: look, touch, smell (safely), listen. Describe what you observe: "I see a bumpy texture on this one" or "This one is very light." Take photos or notes about what captures their attention. Let the child set the pace.

3. **Guided Investigation** (5-8 min):
   Introduce simple investigation approaches like sorting, comparing, or describing. For sorting: "Let's put things that feel the same together. Which are bumpy? Which are smooth?" For comparing: "Which is bigger? Which is heavier?" Model the behavior: "I'm grouping these by color. I'll put the red ones here." Ask gentle discovery questions: "What else could we group these by?"

4. **Documentation & Free Expression** (remaining time):
   Support the child in recording findings through drawing, marking, or photos. Don't require neat documentation—mark-making and pictures count. Celebrate discoveries: "You noticed that both of these are round!" Focus on the discovery process, not perfect record-keeping.

5. **Wrap-Up** (3-5 min):
   Gather items and look at the documentation together. Reflect on discoveries: "What did you find out? What was your favorite?" Celebrate the research process. Make cleanup collaborative and praise it as part of organizing findings.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on free exploration and sensory play with 5-8 items maximum. Use very simple categories: soft/hard, big/small, colors. Emphasize multi-sensory experience over data collection. The adult does most narration and documentation. Keep total time to 15-20 minutes. Expect shorter attention spans and hands-on guidance needs.

**3-4+ years**:
Increase complexity with 12-15 items and multiple investigation methods (sorting, counting, comparing, measuring). Introduce simple note-taking with check boxes, drawings, or labels. Ask more complex questions: "Why do you think these go together?" Encourage the child to explain their thinking. Introduce simple frameworks: living/non-living, or what things are made from. Allow the child to lead the investigation approach. They may sustain engagement for 25-30 minutes.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Themed Collections**
Change the collection theme each session (kitchen items, outdoor treasures, objects from nature, household tools, toys, items by color). Let the child help gather items for the next investigation. Create a "collection box" that builds over time.

**Variation 2: Investigation Challenges**
Give the child a specific question to investigate: "Can you find all the things that are red? The things that roll? The soft things?" Create simple scavenger hunts: "Find something that came from a plant. Find something made of metal."

**Repeat play**:
Investigate the same items in different ways each session (first by color, next by texture, then by size). If the child wants to investigate the same items repeatedly, celebrate this—repetition builds deeper understanding. Add small new items to keep interest fresh without pressure for constant novelty.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or wants to just play with items rather than "investigate"
**Solution**: Let the play be the investigation! Narrate what they're doing as research. Unstructured exploration is developmentally appropriate and still research. Documentation is not necessary—observation and curiosity are enough.

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated with documentation or resists marking/recording
**Solution**: Make documentation playful, not mandatory. Photos and oral descriptions count just as much. Let the child draw however they want. Focus on the discovery process, not perfect record-keeping.

**Challenge**: Child wants to investigate the same items over and over
**Solution**: This is wonderful and normal—repetition builds confidence and deeper understanding. Celebrate this persistence! Add small new items to the collection occasionally, but keep favorites available. Research is about depth, not always novelty.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Create a Research Book**: Collect photos and drawings from investigation sessions in a simple folder. Revisit it later: "Remember when we investigated rocks? What did we find?"

2. **Extend the Investigation**: Use documentation to spark new investigation ideas. "You found 5 smooth things. Should we look for rough things next time?" or "Which of these came from nature? Which came from a store?"

3. **Share Discoveries**: Let the child teach you or a family member about what they discovered. Ask them to show and explain their findings—this deepens their learning and gives them a sense of accomplishment.
