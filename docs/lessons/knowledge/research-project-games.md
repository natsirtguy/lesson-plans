# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Research Project Games

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Research Project Games introduce young learners to the joy of discovery and investigation through playful, hands-on exploration. Children collect items, sort information, and ask questions about their world while developing early research skills and observation abilities. This activity builds curiosity, scientific thinking, and deeper understanding of how we can learn about objects and our environment.

## Vocabulary

**Scientific method**: A systematic process for investigating questions, used by scientists for over 400 years. The steps are: observe something → ask a question → form a hypothesis → design a test → collect data → analyze results → draw a conclusion. This isn't just one way to learn — it's THE process that produced nearly everything we know about the universe, from gravity to germs to galaxies. Even toddlers can follow these steps when guided.

**Variable**: Something you can change, measure, or keep the same in an experiment. In a real experiment, you change one thing (the independent variable), measure what happens (the dependent variable), and keep everything else the same (controlled variables). For example, if you're testing which ball bounces highest, the variable you change is the type of ball, the variable you measure is bounce height, and you control the drop height by keeping it the same each time.

**Data**: Recorded observations — the actual evidence you collect during research. Data can be quantitative (numbers: "this rock weighs 45 grams") or qualitative (descriptions: "this rock is rough and grey"). Scientists write data in notebooks, tables, and charts. Without recorded data, research is just memory — and memory is unreliable. Charles Darwin filled 15 notebooks with data during his voyage on the HMS Beagle.

**Classification**: Organizing things into groups based on shared attributes — a fundamental tool in every science. Carl Linnaeus invented the modern classification system in 1735, organizing all living things into kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. But classification applies everywhere: rocks are classified as igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic; elements are classified in the periodic table; even library books are classified using the Dewey Decimal System.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
We can all be little scientists, E-I-E-I-O
And we'll investigate and explore, E-I-E-I-O
With a look and touch here, and a sort and find there
Here a look, there a touch, everywhere a discovery
We can all be little scientists, E-I-E-I-O

*Verse 2*
We can ask our questions, what and why, E-I-E-I-O
As we gather clues to help us try, E-I-E-I-O
With a count and compare here, and a group things there
Here a count, there a group, everywhere we're learning
We can ask our questions, what and why, E-I-E-I-O

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Touch something and look closely at it (investigate gesture)
2. Sort items by putting similar ones together (grouping motion)
3. Point and ask "What's that?" with a curious expression (wondering gesture)

Through guided investigation—sorting, comparing, describing, and documenting—children develop foundational research skills and discover that learning happens through careful attention and curiosity.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration, hands-on discovery play, guided investigation

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Collection of 10-15 interesting items (natural objects, household items, or themed collection)
- Magnifying glass or hand lens
- Paper, markers, or colored pencils for recording observations
- Containers or baskets for sorting items
- Clipboard or hard surface for documentation

**Optional**:
- Camera or tablet for photographing discoveries
- Chart paper for group documentation
- Picture cards or symbols to label categories
- Natural objects (leaves, rocks, twigs, shells, acorns)
- Small containers with mysterious contents

**Cost**: Free to Under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather 10-15 safe, non-toxic, age-appropriate items (avoid small choking hazards for younger children)
2. Arrange items on a table or display area where the child can easily see and access them
3. Test magnifying glass and materials for safety
4. Prepare paper, markers, and sorting containers within reach
5. Ensure good lighting and a clear flat workspace
6. Have cleanup supplies ready (damp cloth, small trash bin)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Observation — Step 1 of the Scientific Method** (3-5 min):
   "Scientists start every research project with observation — looking carefully at things and noticing details." Reveal the collection. Let the child handle items freely, using all senses. Model scientific observation: "I'm collecting qualitative data right now — that means descriptions, not numbers. This rock is rough, grey, and has sparkly flecks. Those sparkly bits might be mica — a mineral." Record observations aloud: "A real scientist writes down what they observe in a research notebook. Let's draw or write what we notice." Explain: "Every great discovery started with someone looking at something and wondering about it. Charles Darwin spent 8 years just observing barnacles."

2. **Question and Hypothesis — Steps 2 & 3** (3-4 min):
   "Now that we've observed, scientists ask a question. What do you wonder about these things?" Model question-forming: "I wonder — are the heavier objects also bigger? That's my research question." Then form a hypothesis: "A hypothesis is a specific prediction you can test. My hypothesis is: bigger objects will be heavier. Now we need to TEST it — because in science, you don't just guess. You find evidence." Emphasize: "A hypothesis isn't just a guess — it's an informed prediction based on what you already know."

3. **Testing and Data Collection — Steps 4 & 5** (5-8 min):
   Design a simple experiment together: "To test whether bigger things are heavier, we need to control our variables. We'll compare objects of different sizes, but we need to measure them the same way each time." Practice classification: sort by one attribute (color), then re-sort by a different attribute (texture), then a third (weight). Each re-sort is a new way of classifying. Record data: make tally marks, draw items in groups, or use a simple two-column chart. Say: "This is quantitative data — we're counting. We have 4 smooth things and 6 rough things. Scientists use numbers because numbers are precise."

4. **Analysis and Conclusion — Steps 6 & 7** (remaining time):
   Look at the data together: "What does our data tell us? Were bigger objects actually heavier? Let's check." If the hypothesis was wrong: "This is actually great — in science, a wrong hypothesis is still useful. You learned something. Scientists call this a null result, and it happens all the time. The key is that you tested it instead of just guessing." Compare classifications: "When we sorted by color, we got 3 groups. When we sorted by texture, we got 2 groups. The same objects can be classified different ways depending on which variable you use."

5. **Wrap-Up — Peer Review** (3-5 min):
   "Real scientists share their findings with other scientists — this is called peer review. Other people check your work and ask questions." Have the child present one finding: what they investigated, what data they collected, and what they concluded. Ask a question about their method — "How did you decide which group this belongs in?" This is gentle peer review. Discuss: "Research never really ends. Every answer creates new questions. What would you investigate next time?"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use 5-8 items and focus on two scientific method steps: observation and classification. The adult narrates the science: "We're doing qualitative observation — describing what we see and feel." Use the word "data" naturally: "That's good data — you noticed this one is smooth." Keep classifications to one attribute at a time (color, then texture). The adult records data by drawing or tallying. Keep to 15-20 minutes. Even at this age, name the process: "We observed, we classified, we collected data. That's science."

**3-4+ years**:
Work through all seven steps of the scientific method with 12-15 items. The child forms their own hypotheses and designs simple tests. Introduce controlled variables: "If we're testing which things float, we need to use the same bowl of water each time — that's our controlled variable." Use quantitative data: count items in each group, measure with a ruler, weigh with a kitchen scale. Create simple bar charts (draw columns on paper). Introduce the concept of sample size: "We only tested 3 rocks. If we tested 20, we'd have more data and more confidence in our conclusion." Let the child explain their reasoning — this builds the foundation for scientific argumentation. Discuss famous researchers: Jane Goodall observed chimpanzees for 60 years; Marie Curie's research notebooks are still too radioactive to handle without protective equipment.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Themed Collections**
Change the collection theme each session (kitchen items, outdoor treasures, objects from nature, household tools, toys, items by color). Let the child help gather items for the next investigation. Create a "collection box" that builds over time.

**Variation 2: Investigation Challenges**
Give the child a specific question to investigate: "Can you find all the things that are red? The things that roll? The soft things?" Create simple scavenger hunts: "Find something that came from a plant. Find something made of metal."

**Repeat play**:
Investigate the same items in different ways each session (first by color, next by texture, then by size). If the child wants to investigate the same items repeatedly, celebrate this—repetition builds deeper understanding. Add small new items to keep interest fresh without pressure for constant novelty.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or wants to just play with items rather than "investigate"
**Solution**: Let the play be the investigation! Narrate what they're doing as research. Unstructured exploration is developmentally appropriate and still research. Documentation is not necessary—observation and curiosity are enough.

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated with documentation or resists marking/recording
**Solution**: Make documentation playful, not mandatory. Photos and oral descriptions count just as much. Let the child draw however they want. Focus on the discovery process, not perfect record-keeping.

**Challenge**: Child wants to investigate the same items over and over
**Solution**: This is wonderful and normal—repetition builds confidence and deeper understanding. Celebrate this persistence! Add small new items to the collection occasionally, but keep favorites available. Research is about depth, not always novelty.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Research Notebook**: Start a running lab notebook — real scientists keep these throughout their careers. Date each entry, record the research question, hypothesis, data, and conclusion. Over time the child builds a record of their investigations. Discuss how Darwin, da Vinci, and Curie all kept detailed notebooks that are now in museums.

2. **Replication**: Repeat an earlier experiment — in science, a result that can't be replicated isn't considered reliable. Ask: "Do we get the same data when we test again? If not, why might our results be different?" This introduces reproducibility, a cornerstone of the scientific method.

3. **Peer Review Presentation**: Have the child present findings to another family member, who asks questions. This mirrors the scientific peer review process — other researchers challenge your methods and conclusions to make science stronger. Even a 2-year-old can show their sorted groups and point to which group has "more."
