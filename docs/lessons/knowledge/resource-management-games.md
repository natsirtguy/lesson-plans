# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Resource Management Games

## Activity Summary

In this lesson, children explore how to make thoughtful choices about sharing, distributing, and managing limited supplies during play. Through hands-on games and activities, they develop early skills in planning, fairness, and decision-making that build foundations for understanding cause-and-effect, cooperation, and basic economic thinking.

## Vocabulary

**Allocate**: To decide how to divide or distribute something fairly among people or objects. When you allocate your crayons, you decide which colors each friend gets to use.

**Prioritize**: To decide which things are most important and should be taken care of first. You prioritize drinking water before playing because your body needs it most right now.

**Conserve**: To use something carefully and not waste it, so it lasts longer for everyone to enjoy. When we conserve blocks during building time, we have enough pieces to make a taller, bigger tower together.

**Distribute**: To share or give out something so that everyone gets a fair amount. When we distribute crackers for snack time, each person gets the same number of crackers.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: This Old Man

**Tempo**: Cheerful and bouncy

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
We allocate, distribute fair
Sharing items everywhere
Prioritize what matters most
Conserve what we treasure and we share
Making choices every day
Learning how to share and play

Count the items, split them right
Everyone gets some tonight
Distribute fairly, watch us go
Allocate to every friend we know
Managing resources well
Sharing stories we can tell

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will play hands-on resource management games where they divide materials fairly, make choices about limited resources, and think through consequences of their decisions. These concrete experiences build understanding of allocation, fairness, and planning while encouraging thoughtful decision-making and cooperation.

**Activity Type**: Strategic play, hands-on game, decision-making activity

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- 15-30 small objects to manage (buttons, blocks, toy animals, pom-poms, coins, beads, or shells)
- 3-5 containers, baskets, or bags for organizing items
- Simple game space (table, floor, or cloth)

**Optional**:
- Play coins or pretend money
- Picture cards showing objects or choices
- Dice or spinner for chance elements
- Timer for time-based games
- Chart paper to record decisions

**Cost**: Free (using items from home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather 15-30 objects and place them in one central pile so they're easy to access
2. Set out containers or sections where children can organize items
3. Clear a space with good visibility for all materials
4. Safety check: For children under 3, use only large objects (no small choking hazards)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Gather children around the collection of items. Say: "Today we're going to make choices about how to share and use these treasures! We can divide them fairly, decide what's most important, and think about what happens with our choices." Let children explore the items briefly with their hands while you talk.

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   Choose one of three game types:

   **Game Type 1: Fair Division** - "We have 12 items and 3 people. How many does each person get?" Let children count and distribute. Ask: "Does everyone have the same? Is that fair?"

   **Game Type 2: Resource Choices** - "You have 10 items. Which 5 will you keep to play with, and which 5 will we save for later?" Children decide and explain their choices.

   **Game Type 3: Allocation Challenge** - "We have 15 blocks. We want to build with them fairly. How many blocks should each person get?" Children work together to divide and then build.

   Use language that promotes thinking: "Why did you choose that first? What will happen next? Is everyone happy with this?"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Ask reflective questions:
   - "What did you choose first? Why was that important?"
   - "Did everyone get the same amount? How do you know?"
   - "What would happen if one person took everything?"
   - "How did it feel when things were fair?"

   If division was unequal, work together to redistribute: "Let's move some items so everyone has the same number."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Celebrate their thinking: "You did such a good job making fair choices and thinking about what matters! You allocated treasures so everyone could have some." Let them keep their items for free play or reset and play another round with different objects.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep it very simple with only 6-8 familiar objects. Instead of counting, focus on the visual idea of "fair" by using matching containers side-by-side. Use hand-over-hand support to place items one at a time: "One for you, one for me, one for baby." Let them mostly watch you model fair sharing, then copy you. Use very simple language and celebrate all attempts.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce counting and comparison: "You have three items, she has three items—that's equal!" Add constraint challenges: "We only have 10 items for 4 people. What should we do?" Create more complex scenarios: "These are toys for our store. We need enough so each customer can buy something." Let them make independent choices and discuss their reasoning.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Store Scenario**: Set up a simple toy store with items for "sale." Give each child the same amount of play money or buttons to use as currency. Let them decide which items to "buy" with their limited resources. This adds budgeting and choice prioritization.

**Variation 2 - Themed Games**: Create themed scenarios like "These animals need homes—how do we divide them fairly among habitats?" or "We're packing for a picnic but can only carry 5 items—what's most important?" or "We have decorations for the party—where should we put them?"

**Repeat play**: Change the objects each time to keep it fresh (blocks one day, animals another day, buttons another day). Gradually add complexity—try equal distribution one day, unequal the next, and discuss why. Create new scenarios based on child's interests.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Children want all the items and refuse to share.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal at ages 2-3. Don't force sharing; instead, help them see there are enough items for everyone. Acknowledge feelings: "I see you really want all the blocks. We have blocks for you AND blocks for your sister." Focus on turn-taking rather than simultaneous sharing.

**Challenge**: Children don't understand what "fair" or "equal" means.
**Solution**: Use visual, concrete tools like matching containers placed side-by-side, lining items up in a row, or counting on fingers together. Avoid abstract language. Instead use: "same amount" or "same number." Demonstrate with your own items: "See, I have three and you have three—we both have the same!"

**Challenge**: One child dominates or grabs items first.
**Solution**: Structure clear turn-taking using a timer, song, or visual card showing whose turn it is. Go around the circle in order so everyone gets an equal chance. For younger children, you pick for them: "This block is for you, this one is for your friend." This removes pressure and teaches the concept naturally.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Distribution at Home**: Ask your child to help distribute snacks, toys, or supplies during regular routines. Say: "How many grapes should each person get? Let's count and make it fair together."

2. **Toy Rotation System**: Use resource management in real life by rotating toys from a closet. "We can play with these toys today, and we'll save these for tomorrow. That way we always have new things to enjoy and discover."

3. **Real-Life Allocation**: Involve children in simple family decisions about resources: "We have $10 for the store. What do we need most?" or "We can visit two places today. Which would you like to go to first and why?"
