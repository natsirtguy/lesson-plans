# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Resource Management Games

## Activity Summary

In this lesson, children explore how to make thoughtful choices about sharing, distributing, and managing limited supplies during play. Through hands-on games and activities, they develop early skills in planning, fairness, and decision-making that build foundations for understanding cause-and-effect, cooperation, and basic economic thinking.

## Vocabulary

**Scarcity**: When there isn't enough of something for everyone who wants it. Scarcity is what makes resource management necessary — if there were infinite blocks, you'd never need to decide who gets how many. Example: "There are only 10 blocks but three of us want to build — that's scarcity!"

**Allocate**: To decide how to divide limited resources among competing uses or people. When you allocate, you're making a real decision about who or what gets how much of something scarce. Example: "We need to allocate the building blocks — not everyone can have all of them."

**Trade-off**: When you use a resource one way, you can't use it another way — that's a trade-off. Choosing always means giving something up. Example: "If we use all our clay to make a snake, we'll use up our clay — that's a trade-off. We can't also make a bowl."

**Prioritize**: To decide which needs or uses are most important when you can't do everything. Example: "We only have 5 crackers and want to save some for later — we have to prioritize who needs one most right now."

**Conserve**: To use a resource carefully so it lasts longer, stretching a scarce supply. Conserving makes sense when you can't get more. Example: "If we conserve the paint by using small amounts, there'll be enough for everyone to finish their picture."

**Budget**: A plan for exactly how to use a limited amount of something. A budget helps you avoid running out by deciding in advance what gets what. Example: "We have 12 stickers to budget for three projects — let's plan how many each project gets before we start."

## Learning Song

**Tune**: This Old Man

**Tempo**: Cheerful and bouncy

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
We allocate, distribute fair
Sharing items everywhere
Prioritize what matters most
Conserve what we treasure and we share
Making choices every day
Learning how to share and play

*Verse 2*
Count the items, split them right
Everyone gets some tonight
Distribute fairly, watch us go
Allocate to every friend we know
Managing resources well
Sharing stories we can tell

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Use hands to "distribute" items to different sides
2. Point to different people when sharing
3. Count on fingers when allocating and distributing items

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will play hands-on resource management games where they divide materials fairly, make choices about limited resources, and think through consequences of their decisions. These concrete experiences build understanding of allocation, fairness, and planning while encouraging thoughtful decision-making and cooperation.

**Activity Type**: Strategic play, hands-on game, decision-making activity

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- 15-30 small objects to manage (buttons, blocks, toy animals, pom-poms, coins, beads, or shells)
- 3-5 containers, baskets, or bags for organizing items
- Simple game space (table, floor, or cloth)

**Optional**:
- Play coins or pretend money
- Picture cards showing objects or choices
- Dice or spinner for chance elements
- Timer for time-based games
- Chart paper to record decisions

**Cost**: Free (using items from home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather 15-30 objects and place them in one central pile so they're easy to access
2. Set out containers or sections where children can organize items
3. Clear a space with good visibility for all materials
4. Safety check: For children under 3, use only large objects (no small choking hazards)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Gather children around the collection of items. Say: "Today we're going to make choices about how to share and use these treasures! We can divide them fairly, decide what's most important, and think about what happens with our choices." Let children explore the items briefly with their hands while you talk.

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   Introduce the core idea first: "These blocks are scarce — there aren't enough for everyone to have as many as they want. So we have to make a plan — a budget — for how to use them." Then choose one game type:

   **Game Type 1: Scarcity and Trade-offs** - Set out 10 blocks and three building projects (tower, wall, bridge). "We only have 10 blocks for three buildings. We can't build all three the same size — that's a trade-off. How do we allocate them?" Help children decide; when they spend blocks on one, narrate: "Those 5 blocks are in the tower now — we can't use them for the bridge. That's the trade-off."

   **Game Type 2: Budget Challenge** - "You have 10 items to budget for the whole day: 5 different activities, each needs at least 1 item. Plan how you'll use them without running out." Children must think ahead and plan rather than just dividing.

   **Game Type 3: Scarcity Role Play** - "Our explorer team has 8 food items but 3 people and a long journey. How do we allocate the food so everyone has enough and some is conserved for emergencies?" This scenario frames resource management as real strategy.

   Use language that highlights the real concepts: "If you use it here, you can't use it there — what trade-off are you making? Is there scarcity in this situation?"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Ask reflective questions:
   - "Why do we need to manage these resources? What would happen if there were unlimited blocks?"
   - "What trade-off did you make? What did you give up by choosing that?"
   - "Did you make a budget before you started, or did you run out? What would you do differently?"
   - "Scarcity means not enough for everyone — where do you see scarcity in real life?" (One cookie left, only one person can use the swings at once, family has only so much money to spend)

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Summarize the real concept: "Resource management is about making choices when there isn't enough of something for everyone — that's scarcity. You had to allocate, make trade-offs, and budget. Real families, towns, and countries do this every day with money, food, water, and land." Let children keep items for free play or reset for another round.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep it very simple with only 6-8 familiar objects. Instead of counting, focus on the visual idea of "fair" by using matching containers side-by-side. Use hand-over-hand support to place items one at a time: "One for you, one for me, one for baby." Let them mostly watch you model fair sharing, then copy you. Use very simple language and celebrate all attempts.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce counting and comparison: "You have three items, she has three items—that's equal!" Add constraint challenges: "We only have 10 items for 4 people. What should we do?" Create more complex scenarios: "These are toys for our store. We need enough so each customer can buy something." Let them make independent choices and discuss their reasoning.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Store Scenario**: Set up a simple toy store with items for "sale." Give each child the same amount of play money or buttons to use as currency. Let them decide which items to "buy" with their limited resources. This adds budgeting and choice prioritization.

**Variation 2 - Themed Games**: Create themed scenarios like "These animals need homes—how do we divide them fairly among habitats?" or "We're packing for a picnic but can only carry 5 items—what's most important?" or "We have decorations for the party—where should we put them?"

**Repeat play**: Change the objects each time to keep it fresh (blocks one day, animals another day, buttons another day). Gradually add complexity—try equal distribution one day, unequal the next, and discuss why. Create new scenarios based on child's interests.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Children want all the items and refuse to share.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal at ages 2-3. Don't force sharing; instead, help them see there are enough items for everyone. Acknowledge feelings: "I see you really want all the blocks. We have blocks for you AND blocks for your sister." Focus on turn-taking rather than simultaneous sharing.

**Challenge**: Children don't understand what "fair" or "equal" means.
**Solution**: Use visual, concrete tools like matching containers placed side-by-side, lining items up in a row, or counting on fingers together. Avoid abstract language. Instead use: "same amount" or "same number." Demonstrate with your own items: "See, I have three and you have three—we both have the same!"

**Challenge**: One child dominates or grabs items first.
**Solution**: Structure clear turn-taking using a timer, song, or visual card showing whose turn it is. Go around the circle in order so everyone gets an equal chance. For younger children, you pick for them: "This block is for you, this one is for your friend." This removes pressure and teaches the concept naturally.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Distribution at Home**: Ask your child to help distribute snacks, toys, or supplies during regular routines. Say: "How many grapes should each person get? Let's count and make it fair together."

2. **Toy Rotation System**: Use resource management in real life by rotating toys from a closet. "We can play with these toys today, and we'll save these for tomorrow. That way we always have new things to enjoy and discover."

3. **Real-Life Allocation**: Involve children in simple family decisions about resources: "We have $10 for the store. What do we need most?" or "We can visit two places today. Which would you like to go to first and why?"
