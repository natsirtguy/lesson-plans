# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Role-Playing and Simulation

## Activity Summary

Children engage in imaginative pretend play, taking on different roles and acting out scenarios that help them understand the world around them. Through role-playing, children develop social skills, practice new behaviors, explore different perspectives, and learn how to navigate real-world situations in a safe, playful environment.

## Vocabulary

**Theory of Mind**: The ability to understand that other people have thoughts, feelings, and knowledge that are *different from your own*. This is one of the most important things a young brain develops, and role-playing is one of the main ways children practice it — when you "be" someone else, you have to imagine how *they* think and feel.

**Symbolic thinking**: Using one thing to represent something else — like using a banana as a telephone, or a blanket as a spaceship. This is a major cognitive milestone: the brain has to hold *two* ideas at once (this is a banana AND it's a phone right now). All language, math, and art rely on symbolic thinking.

**Simulate**: To recreate or model something in a controlled, safe environment in order to practice or understand it. Children simulate social situations through pretend play. Adults simulate too — pilots train on flight simulators, surgeons practice on models, scientists run computer simulations before experiments. Simulation is a core human strategy for learning without real-world risk.

**Empathy**: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another person — to feel what they might be feeling. Role-playing builds empathy because you practice *being* someone else: their perspective, their problems, their emotions.

**Executive function**: A set of mental skills that includes holding information in mind while doing something else (*working memory*), stopping yourself from doing what you immediately want (*inhibitory control*), and switching between tasks or perspectives (*cognitive flexibility*). Role-play strengthens all three — to stay "in character" you must hold the character's identity in mind, suppress your own reactions, and flexibly respond to whatever the other person does.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: If You're Happy and You Know It

**Tempo**: Upbeat and energetic

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
If you want to simulate, act it out
If you want to simulate, act it out
Pick a character to be
In a fun scenario
If you want to simulate, act it out

*Verse 2*
If you like to improvise, make it up
If you like to improvise, make it up
Be creative as you play
Characters in every way
If you like to improvise, make it up

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Act out different characters (doctor checking, chef cooking, animal moving)
2. Gesture widely when improvising to show creativity
3. Point to self when choosing a character, then act out the role

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will create and act out simple pretend scenarios, taking on different roles and practicing social interactions in a safe, playful setting. This builds confidence, social awareness, and creative expression while helping children learn how different people and animals behave.

**Activity Type**: Dramatic play / Role-playing simulation

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Props from around your home (scarves, hats, shoes, glasses)
- Stuffed animals or dolls
- Simple furniture (chairs, blankets for building)
- Household items (pots, spoons, plates for pretend cooking)

**Optional**:
- Dress-up clothes or oversized adult clothing
- Play kitchen, toy cash register, or toy phone
- Doctor's kit or toy stethoscope
- Face paint or costume accessories
- Picture cards showing different professions or scenarios

**Cost**: Free (using household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather 3-4 simple props and arrange them in an open play space
2. Create a defined "play area" using blankets, cushions, or rearranged furniture
3. Ensure the space is safe with no tripping hazards or dangerous items nearby

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (3-4 min):
   Connect pretend play to the real world: "Do you know that grown-ups use pretend too? Pilots practice flying in a pretend airplane called a *simulator* before they fly a real one. Doctors practice on models before doing real surgery. Pretending is actually a smart way to practice something safely before doing the real thing."

   Introduce symbolic thinking explicitly: hold up a banana like a phone. "Right now in my head, this is a phone. I'm holding *two* ideas at once — banana AND phone. When you do that, you're doing *symbolic thinking*, and that's actually one of the most important things your brain can do. All reading and math work that way too."

2. **Theory of Mind Exploration** (8-12 min):
   Choose a role scenario (doctor and patient, shopkeeper and customer, chef and hungry person).

   Before playing, pause to discuss perspective: "I'm going to be the customer. What do you think the customer is feeling? What does she need? What might she be worried about?" Then switch: "Now you be the customer — what are YOU feeling?" This explicit perspective-taking conversation is the core intellectual work of this activity.

   During play, narrate the characters' inner experiences: "The patient feels nervous — her leg hurts. The doctor is calm because she knows what to do." This models the mental model-building that is Theory of Mind.

   Ask questions that require perspective-taking: "The customer doesn't know the ice cream is sold out yet. How will she feel when she finds out?" (This is a classic *false belief* test — the child must track what the character knows vs. what is actually true.)

3. **Symbolic Thinking Challenge** (3-4 min):
   Grab random household objects and ask: "What could this be?" A cardboard tube → telescope, trumpet, periscope. A pot lid → steering wheel, shield, drum.

   Say: "Your brain just did something powerful — it saw one thing and imagined it as something else. That's called symbolic thinking. When you learn to read, every letter is a symbol for a sound. Your brain is already trained for this!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Reflect: "When you pretended to be [character], you had to think about how they feel and what they want — not what YOU feel. That's called empathy. Scientists have found that children who do lots of pretend play get better at understanding other people's feelings. You just practiced that today."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on symbolic object play — this is where 2-year-olds are developmentally. Hold up a spoon and say "I'm going to pretend this is a microphone!" and sing into it. When they do the same, name what they're doing: "You're using symbolic thinking — you made that block into a car!" For Theory of Mind, keep it simple: "The teddy bear is hungry. How does the hungry bear feel?" This seeds the concept without requiring complex reasoning yet.

**3-4+ years**:
Run the full false belief exercise: set up a scenario where a character doesn't know something that the child knows (e.g., the doll "doesn't know" that you moved the snack). Ask: "Where will the doll LOOK for the snack?" (where she last saw it) vs. where it actually is. This is the classic Sally-Anne test that psychologists use to assess Theory of Mind development — it's appropriate and genuinely fascinating for this age. Introduce *empathy* by name: "When you can imagine how someone else feels, that's called empathy."

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Occupation Tour**: Pick a profession each day (baker, farmer, mail carrier) and act out their job in detail, using real tools or homemade equivalents.

**Variation 2 - Adventure Scenarios**: Set up imaginary locations (jungle, ocean, space station, forest) and act out exploring and discovering things there.

**Variation 3 - Story Re-enactment**: After reading a favorite book, act out the story together with the child as the main character and you as another character.

**Repeat play**: Change props and scenarios frequently to keep interest fresh. Let the child suggest what to pretend next rather than repeating the same scenario each time. Build a "prop box" and let them rummage through it for inspiration.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child stays in one familiar role and won't try new ones
**Solution**: Don't force variety - repeated play in the same role is developmentally important and helps build confidence. Gradually introduce new roles through stories, videos, or field trips. Offer props and say "I wonder what we could be with this?" rather than directing. When they're ready, they'll expand their roles naturally.

**Challenge**: Child uses aggressive actions in pretend play (hitting, rough movements)
**Solution**: This is normal exploration of power and cause-and-effect. Gently redirect: "Superheroes can save people with their STRONG arms! Let's punch this pillow together!" Set clear boundaries: "We use gentle hands with people, but we can stomp like dinosaurs on the ground." Offer safe outlets like dancing wildly, stomping, or squeezing play dough.

**Challenge**: Child won't engage in role-play or stays silent
**Solution**: Not all children are naturally dramatic - this is normal. Start by playing alongside them with their toys, narrating their actions without forcing them to talk. Use toys to act out scenarios near them rather than directing them. Some children learn best by watching first before joining in. Respect their pace.

**Challenge**: Transition out of pretend play is difficult
**Solution**: Give clear warnings: "In 5 minutes we need to finish being doctors and clean up." Use a transition phrase like "Let's put our doctor hats away safely." Praise their work: "You were such a good doctor today!" Let them store props somewhere visible so they know pretend play will be available again tomorrow.

### Follow-Up Activities
1. **Photo Documentation**: Take photos during pretend play and create a simple book: "Today we were doctors!" This helps children reflect on what they did.
2. **Costume Creation**: Help make simple props together (decorate a paper crown, cut felt masks) to build anticipation for next pretend play session.
3. **Real-World Connection**: Visit places related to roles they've pretended (grocery store, park, fire station) so they see how real people do these jobs. Talk about what you saw: "Remember when we pretended to be shopkeepers? Let's see what the real shopkeeper does!"
