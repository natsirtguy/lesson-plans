# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Route Planning and Navigation

## Activity Summary

Children learn how to find their way from one place to another by recognizing landmarks, following paths, and understanding directions. Through exploration and guided discovery, they develop spatial awareness and the confidence to navigate familiar spaces independently.

## Vocabulary

**Navigate**: To find your way from one place to another by looking for landmarks and following paths. When you navigate, you're like an explorer discovering your way—such as walking from your bedroom to the kitchen by remembering where the door is.

**Route**: The path or way you take to get from one place to another. A route is a specific path you decide to follow—like taking the sidewalk path instead of cutting through the grass to reach the park.

**Landmark**: Something you can see in your surroundings that helps you know where you are or remember where to go next. A big tree, a mailbox, or a colorful door are landmarks that help you find your way.

**Journey**: A trip or movement from one place to another with a beginning and an ending point. Every time you walk from home to the store, you're taking a journey that has its own special path.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 4 lines each):

*Verse 1*
We can follow down the path
See the landmarks on the way
Turn left, turn right, find our place
We can navigate today

*Verse 2*
Maps and routes show where to go
Down the street and through the door
Walking, walking on our way
Finding routes we're looking for

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point ahead with one hand (following a path)
2. Turn body left, then right (turning directions)
3. Walk your fingers forward on your other arm (walking a route)

## Intro Video Recommendation

**Recommended video**: Search for "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood - Neighborhood Places" or "Bluey - Finding Your Way Home"

**What to look for**:
- 2-5 minutes long
- Characters navigating familiar spaces (home, neighborhood, classroom)
- Landmarks and paths clearly visible
- Friendly narration that labels locations
- Safe, age-appropriate content without scary elements

**Alternative searches** (if specific videos unavailable):
- "Toddler navigation activity preschool"
- "Following paths and directions for preschoolers"
- "Landmarks and navigation for young children"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children create and follow a simple route through a familiar space, discovering landmarks along the way and practicing giving and following directions. They'll develop confidence in navigating their environment while learning about spatial relationships and directional language.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on exploration and guided navigation

**Duration**: 12-18 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Familiar indoor or outdoor space (home, yard, classroom)
- Optional: colored tape or ribbons to mark a path
- Optional: paper and crayons to draw a simple map afterward

**Optional**:
- Small flags or signs to mark landmarks
- A simple toy or doll to navigate the route
- Camera to photograph the route for a "memory map"

**Cost**: Free (using household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose a familiar route in your home, classroom, or yard (5-8 steps)
2. Identify 3-4 landmarks along the way (a door, a chair, a tree, a toy)
3. Clear any obstacles or hazards from the path
4. Safety check: Make sure the route is safe and appropriate for the child's mobility level

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Sit with the child and explain: "Today we're going on a navigation adventure! That means we're going to find our way from one place to another by looking for special things called landmarks. A landmark is something we see that helps us know where we're going, like that big red chair or the kitchen door."

2. **Exploration** (7-10 min):
   Walk the route together slowly. At each landmark, stop and point it out:
   - "Here's our first landmark—the red chair! We turn right here."
   - "Do you see the doorway? That's our next landmark. Now we're going through it."
   - Let the child lead sometimes, following their choices while gently guiding
   - Use directional language: up, down, left, right, forward, backward, through, around
   - Allow them to touch or interact with landmarks as appropriate

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Ask open-ended questions:
   - "What landmarks do we see?" (point out what they notice)
   - "Which way do we go—left or right?" (reinforce directions)
   - "Can you remember the route by yourself?" (offer guidance as needed)
   - "What did we pass first? What comes next?" (build sequencing awareness)
   Celebrate their observations and memory!

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   "You just navigated! You found your way by looking for landmarks and following a route. Great job exploring!" Optional: Draw a simple stick-figure map or take a photo of the route to remember your navigation journey.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep the route very short (3-4 steps maximum). Use simple one-word or two-word directions ("Go there," "Turn left"). Repeat the route multiple times in one session. Use highly visible, interesting landmarks. Focus on the physical experience of walking the route rather than verbalization.

**3-4+ years**:
Create slightly longer routes (6-8 steps). Introduce more complex directions and landmark descriptions. Challenge them to remember and retell the route. Have them lead you along the route. Create a simple map together afterward (stick figures and shapes). Introduce the words "navigate," "landmark," and "route" more formally.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Toy Route**: Use toy figures, toy vehicles, or dolls to navigate a route you create on the floor using tape, string, or blocks. The child directs the toy's movement and names landmarks.

**Variation 2 - Scavenger Path**: Create a simple route with "treasures" or hidden items at each landmark. The child navigates to find them, reinforcing movement and discovery.

**Repeat Play**: Change the starting point and ending point of the same route. Try navigating it backward. Add new landmarks to the route. Walk the route at different times of day and notice what changes.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: The child gets distracted or wanders off the designated route.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal for this age. Make it playful—use colorful tape to mark the path, turn landmarks into fun stops ("Let's visit the red chair!"), or use a toy animal to navigate alongside them. Breaking the route into smaller segments (stop after 2-3 landmarks) helps maintain focus.

**Challenge**: The child is unsure about left and right or becomes confused by directions.
**Solution**: Don't worry—left and right directionality develops gradually. Use landmarks instead: "We go to the big window," not "We turn right." Use their body: "Turn toward where the sun comes in," or "Turn the way you wave goodbye." Repetition over many sessions builds understanding.

**Challenge**: The child is very literal and insists on following the exact same route every time.
**Solution**: This is fine and shows they're building memory and confidence. Gradually introduce tiny variations (a slightly different landmark, different starting point) over multiple sessions when they're ready. Some children thrive on predictable routes before exploring variations.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Neighborhood Walk**: Take a short, familiar walk in your neighborhood and talk about the landmarks you pass (the big oak tree, the red mailbox, the blue house). Build on their real-world navigation experience.

2. **Home Map Making**: Together, draw a very simple map of one room or a familiar path using shapes and colors. This bridges the concrete route-following experience with symbolic thinking.

3. **Role-Play Navigation**: Have the child direct a toy or stuffed animal where to go using landmarks: "Go to the window, then to the door." This reverses the role and strengthens their understanding of routes and direction-giving.
