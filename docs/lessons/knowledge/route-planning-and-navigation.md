# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Route Planning and Navigation

## Activity Summary

Children learn how to find their way from one place to another by recognizing landmarks, following paths, and understanding directions. Through exploration and guided discovery, they develop spatial awareness and the confidence to navigate familiar spaces independently.

## Vocabulary

**Navigate**: To find your way from one place to another using landmarks, maps, or directions. Real navigators — sailors, pilots, and even honeybees — use tools and natural clues to navigate across the world.

**Route**: The specific path you take to get from one place to another. A route can be drawn on a map, described with directions, or memorized by following familiar landmarks.

**Landmark**: A visible feature — a big tree, a mountain, a building, a mailbox — that tells you where you are or which way to go. Before GPS, sailors navigated entirely by landmarks and the stars.

**Cardinal directions**: The four main compass directions: North, South, East, and West. Every map and every compass is organized around these four directions. The sun always rises in the East and sets in the West, which means you can use the sun itself to navigate!

**Compass**: A navigation tool with a magnetic needle that always points North, because Earth acts like a giant magnet. Compasses have been used for over 1,000 years to help people navigate at sea and on land.

**Map**: A drawing that represents a real space from above (a "bird's-eye view"). Maps use symbols, a legend (a key that explains the symbols), and scale (how big something on the map is compared to real life) to show where things are.

**Spatial memory**: Your brain's ability to remember where things are and how to get there. Even very young children build spatial memory when they learn the route from their bedroom to the kitchen, or remember where toys are stored.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: The Itsy Bitsy Spider

**Tempo**: Steady and adventurous

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
We navigate along the route
Finding landmarks as we go
Journey takes us here and there
Following the path we know
Look for signs along the way
Landmarks help us find our route
That's how we explore today

*Verse 2*
Navigate through here and there
Routes will lead us on our way
Landmarks show us where to turn
Journey happens every day
Left and right and straight ahead
Following our route so clear
Finding where the path will lead

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point forward and walk fingers along arm to show following a route
2. Look around and point to imaginary landmarks
3. Turn body left and right when navigating directions

## How Animals Navigate

Humans aren't the only navigators — animals use remarkable built-in systems:

- **Migratory birds** (like Arctic terns and geese) sense Earth's magnetic field with specialized cells in their eyes and beaks. They can detect which direction is North without any compass — they *are* the compass.
- **Honeybees** use the sun as a compass. When a bee finds flowers, it flies back to the hive and performs a "waggle dance" — a figure-eight movement — to tell other bees the exact direction and distance to the flowers, using the sun's angle as a reference.
- **Sea turtles** navigate across entire oceans using both Earth's magnetic field and ocean currents, returning to the same beach where they were born decades later.
- **Salmon** navigate by smell — they remember the unique chemical "scent" of the river where they hatched and follow it back to spawn.

Human babies begin building **spatial memory** from birth — learning where familiar people, sounds, and objects are located in their world.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children create and follow a simple route through a familiar space, discovering landmarks along the way and practicing giving and following directions. They'll develop confidence in navigating their environment while learning about spatial relationships and directional language.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on exploration, map-making, and guided navigation

**Duration**: 12-18 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Familiar indoor or outdoor space (home, yard, classroom)
- Optional: colored tape or ribbons to mark a path
- Optional: paper and crayons to draw a simple map afterward

**Optional**:
- Small flags or signs to mark landmarks
- A simple toy or doll to navigate the route
- Camera to photograph the route for a "memory map"

**Cost**: Free (using household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose a familiar route in your home, classroom, or yard (5-8 steps)
2. Identify 3-4 landmarks along the way (a door, a chair, a tree, a toy)
3. Clear any obstacles or hazards from the path
4. Safety check: Make sure the route is safe and appropriate for the child's mobility level

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Introduce the big ideas: "Today we're going to learn how navigators find their way! Navigators are people — and animals — who figure out how to get from one place to another. Did you know honeybees navigate by watching where the sun is? And some birds can sense the Earth's magnetic field — it's like they have a compass inside their head! We're going to practice navigating too."

   Point toward different walls and introduce cardinal directions: "North, South, East, West — these are the four cardinal directions. Every compass and every map uses them. The sun rises in the East every morning." (Point toward where the sun rises in your home if possible.)

2. **Exploration** (7-10 min):
   Walk the route together slowly. At each landmark, stop and name it:
   - "Here's our first landmark — the red chair! We turn right here."
   - "Do you see the doorway? That's our next landmark. We're heading North."
   - Use directional language: North/South/East/West, left, right, forward, through, around
   - Allow them to touch or interact with landmarks as appropriate

3. **Map-Making** (3-5 min):
   Draw a simple bird's-eye-view map of the route together:
   - "A map is what the route looks like from above, as if a bird were looking down."
   - Draw boxes or shapes for rooms, lines for paths, and symbols for landmarks (a star = the chair, a square = the doorway)
   - Add a legend: "A legend tells people what each symbol means — like a secret code."
   - Add an arrow pointing North at the top of the map.
   - Ask: "Can you remember the route just by looking at our map?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   "You navigated using landmarks and cardinal directions — just like real explorers! You also made a map with a legend. Navigators use maps exactly like this." Reinforce: "North is that way. When you go outside, you can use the sun to figure out East and West."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep the route very short (3-4 steps maximum). Use simple one-word or two-word directions ("Go there," "Turn left"). Repeat the route multiple times in one session. Use highly visible, interesting landmarks. Focus on the physical experience of walking the route rather than verbalization.

**3-4+ years**:
Create slightly longer routes (6-8 steps). Introduce cardinal directions (N/S/E/W) explicitly — point them out on a real compass if available. Challenge them to remember and retell the route. Have them lead you along the route. Draw a map with a legend (symbol key) and a North arrow. Discuss: "Why do maps always put North at the top?" (Convention — it helps everyone agree.) Ask: "How do you think birds find their way when they fly to warm places in winter?" (They sense Earth's magnetic field.)

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Treasure Map**: Draw a map of a room with a hidden "treasure." Add a legend explaining each symbol. Child navigates by reading the map to find the treasure. Reinforce: "You're reading a map — just like a real explorer!"

**Variation 2 - Sun Compass**: On a sunny day, go outside and figure out East together (where the sun rises). Then find West (sunset direction), North, and South. Mark them with chalk or flags. Practice navigating using only cardinal directions instead of landmarks.

**Variation 3 - Animal Navigator Role Play**: "Let's navigate like a honeybee! When you find the snack (the flower), come back and do the waggle dance to show me where it is." Act out how bees communicate directions through dance.

**Repeat Play**: Change the starting point and ending point of the same route. Try navigating it backward. Add new landmarks to the route. Walk the route at different times of day and notice how the sun's position changes.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: The child gets distracted or wanders off the designated route.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal for this age. Make it playful—use colorful tape to mark the path, turn landmarks into fun stops ("Let's visit the red chair!"), or use a toy animal to navigate alongside them. Breaking the route into smaller segments (stop after 2-3 landmarks) helps maintain focus.

**Challenge**: The child is unsure about left and right or becomes confused by directions.
**Solution**: Don't worry—left and right directionality develops gradually. Use landmarks instead: "We go to the big window," not "We turn right." Use their body: "Turn toward where the sun comes in," or "Turn the way you wave goodbye." Repetition over many sessions builds understanding.

**Challenge**: The child is very literal and insists on following the exact same route every time.
**Solution**: This is fine and shows they're building memory and confidence. Gradually introduce tiny variations (a slightly different landmark, different starting point) over multiple sessions when they're ready. Some children thrive on predictable routes before exploring variations.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Neighborhood Walk**: Take a short, familiar walk in your neighborhood and talk about the landmarks you pass (the big oak tree, the red mailbox, the blue house). Build on their real-world navigation experience.

2. **Home Map Making**: Together, draw a very simple map of one room or a familiar path using shapes and colors. This bridges the concrete route-following experience with symbolic thinking.

3. **Role-Play Navigation**: Have the child direct a toy or stuffed animal where to go using landmarks: "Go to the window, then to the door." This reverses the role and strengthens their understanding of routes and direction-giving.
