# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Safety and Security Activities

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Through interactive play and exploration, children learn essential safety awareness and practical protective skills like recognizing safe situations, calling for help, and establishing secure spaces. Kids develop confidence and understanding of their environment while practicing safety skills in age-appropriate, non-threatening ways that empower rather than frighten them.

## Vocabulary

**Hazard**: Something that could cause harm or injury. A hazard isn't always dangerous on its own—it depends on whether you know about it and how you respond to it. A hot stove is a hazard; knowing not to touch it makes you safer.

**Risk**: The chance that something harmful could happen. We assess risk every day: "Is this street safe to cross right now?" Recognizing risk is a skill—it means paying attention to what's around you.

**Emergency**: A sudden, serious situation that needs immediate action. Emergencies need fast responses—that's why we learn what to do *before* they happen.

**Emergency services**: Trained professionals who respond to emergencies—police officers, firefighters, and paramedics (emergency medical technicians, or EMTs). In many countries, calling **911** (or **999** or **112**) connects you to a dispatcher who coordinates the right help.

**Dispatcher**: The person who answers emergency calls, collects information, and sends the correct response team. Dispatchers stay on the phone with callers to give instructions while help is on the way.

**First responder**: A professional who arrives first at an emergency scene—paramedics, firefighters, police. Each type is trained for specific hazards (medical crises, fires, crimes).

**Pathogen**: A tiny organism—like bacteria or viruses—that can make you sick. Pathogens travel through touch, droplets, and contaminated surfaces. Hand-washing removes pathogens before they enter your body through your eyes, mouth, or nose.

**Smoke detector**: A device that senses smoke particles in the air and sounds an alarm. Most use *photoelectric sensors* (smoke blocks a light beam, triggering the alarm) or *ionization chambers* (smoke disrupts a tiny electrical current). Either way, they detect danger faster than humans can smell smoke alone.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Baa, Baa, Black Sheep

**Tempo**: Slow and gentle

**Lyrics** (2 verses):

*Verse 1*
Safe, safe, always stay,
Close to grown-ups every day,
Hold a hand when we cross streets,
Look both ways, safe and neat,
Safe, safe, always stay,
Keeping danger far away.

*Verse 2*
When you're scared, use your voice,
Tell a grown-up—that's a choice,
Safe spaces help us rest,
Knowing safety is the best,
We are strong, we are brave,
Knowing how to keep us safe.

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Hold hands and sway side to side during verses
2. Look left and right (exaggerated head turns) at "look both ways"
3. Point to chest at "use your voice" and "we are strong"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children learn and practice essential safety skills through picture-based discussions, role-play scenarios, and hands-on exploration. They'll identify safe versus unsafe choices, practice calling for help, establish a personal safe space, and role-play with helpers, building competence and confidence in their ability to stay protected.

**Activity Type**: Role-play / Practical life skills demonstration / Social-emotional learning

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards showing safe vs. unsafe situations (8-10 images)—printed or hand-drawn
- Toy telephone or real phone for practice
- Blanket or cushions to create a "safe space"
- Dolls or stuffed animals for practicing safety scenarios

**Optional**:
- Safety signs (stop sign, caution, exit sign) for discussion
- Toy first aid kit with basic supplies
- Simple costume pieces (police hat, firefighter vest, doctor stethoscope)
- Flashlight for visibility discussion
- Traffic cones or tape for marking safe paths
- Children's books about personal safety

**Cost**: Free to $10 (most items are household items; books from library)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather picture cards showing 8-10 safety scenarios (holding hands while walking, saying "No" to strangers, crossing streets safely, fire safety, washing hands, etc.)
2. Prepare a comfortable, open space where children can move, sit, and talk freely
3. Set up toy phone or identify a real phone the child can practice with
4. Create a cozy "safe space" with a blanket or cushions in a quiet corner
5. Review all content to ensure it's age-appropriate and uses calm, reassuring language

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Sit comfortably with the child and introduce: "Today we're learning about hazards, emergencies, and the systems people use to stay safe." Use familiar examples: "When we hold hands crossing the street, that's because cars are a hazard—they move fast and are heavy. When we look both ways, we're assessing risk: 'Is it safe to cross right now?'" Explain that safety isn't just luck—it's knowledge and planning.

2. **Picture Discussion** (5-7 min):
   Show picture cards one at a time. Ask: "What's happening here?" "Is this a hazard? Why?" "What's the risk?" For each scenario, add real context:
   - **Crossing the street**: Cars have momentum—they can't stop instantly. Traffic lights coordinate vehicles so pedestrians can cross safely.
   - **Washing hands**: Germs (bacteria and viruses) live on surfaces. Soap breaks apart the oily coating on bacteria and viruses so water can wash them away—that's why just rinsing doesn't work as well.
   - **Smoke detector beeping**: It sensed smoke particles—something nearby might be burning. That's why we never ignore the alarm.
   - **Emergency numbers**: 911 connects to a dispatcher who sends police, fire, or medical help depending on the emergency.

3. **Practice & Role-Play** (5-10 min):
   Choose one or two activities to practice:
   - **Calling for help**: Explain how emergency calls work: "When you call 911, a dispatcher answers. They're trained to help. You tell them your name, what happened, and where you are—your address." Practice this script with a toy phone. Explain that dispatchers stay on the line to give instructions while first responders drive to you.
   - **Smoke detector walk**: Find smoke detectors in your home. Explain: "This device protects us even when we're asleep. It senses smoke before we can smell it." Press the test button (warn the child first—it's loud!) so they know what it sounds like. Discuss the fire escape plan.
   - **Hand-washing science**: Do a proper hand-washing demonstration—20 seconds with soap. Explain: "Soap molecules have one end that grabs onto oil and one end that grabs onto water. So germs get trapped in the soap and washed away."
   - **Safety walk**: Walk through the home identifying hazards (stairs, hot oven, cleaning supplies under the sink). For each: "What's the hazard? What's the risk? What do we do?"
   - **First responder roles**: Discuss what each type of first responder does: paramedics treat injuries and illness, firefighters handle fires and rescues, police handle crimes and accidents. Each requires years of specialized training.

4. **Free Exploration** (remaining time):
   Let the child choose which safety activity to practice again. Use props for continued role-play. If interested, play a simple "Can you remember?" game reviewing safe choices. Tell a story together about a character staying safe.

5. **Wrap-Up** (2-3 min):
   Summarize what you learned: "Today you learned about safe choices and practiced calling for help. You're so smart about safety!" Ask: "What was your favorite safe thing we practiced?" Connect to real life: "Tomorrow when we go to the park, we can practice looking both ways together." Praise their effort: "You did such a good job learning about safety today!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use real terms in simple sentences: "That's a hazard—it could hurt you." Focus on concrete hazards they encounter: stairs, hot things, the street. When washing hands together, say "soap kills germs" every time—they won't understand fully, but they'll absorb the concept. Point to the smoke detector: "That keeps us safe at night—it can smell smoke." Keep each conversation to 2-3 minutes. Repetition across daily life is the lesson. Duration: 10-15 minutes or short moments throughout the day.

**3-4+ years**:
Expand to systems: "When someone calls 911, a dispatcher sends a first responder—a paramedic, police officer, or firefighter, depending on what kind of emergency it is." Practice the 911 script: name, location, what happened. Introduce the concept of risk assessment: "Before we cross, we check both ways. Why? Because cars have momentum—once they're moving fast, they can't stop right away." Explore smoke detectors together. Create a home hazard map—draw rooms and mark hazards with symbols. Learn the home address. Duration: 20-30 minutes.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Safety Hunt Around the Home
Walk through your home finding safety items on a checklist: fire extinguisher, first aid kit, emergency exits, phone, safe hiding place. Make it an adventure: "Can you find the first aid kit?"

**Variation 2**: Dress-Up as Safety Helpers
Provide costume pieces (police hat, firefighter vest, doctor stethoscope). Child role-plays being the helper while you need assistance. This reverses the power dynamic in a healthy, confidence-building way.

**Variation 3**: Create a Family Safety Book
Draw or print pictures showing your family's safety rules and emergency plans—where everyone meets if separated, emergency numbers, safe rooms in the house. Read it together regularly.

**Variation 4**: Community Helper Stories
If possible, have a police officer, firefighter, or paramedic briefly explain their safety role in age-appropriate terms. Children feel more empowered knowing helpers exist in their community.

**Variation 5**: Safety Rules Song
Create a simple tune and sing repeatedly about safety rules. Repetition through song aids memory and makes learning fun.

**Repeat play**: Children benefit from repeating safety learning across many days and situations. Practice during everyday activities—holding hands when walking, looking both ways before crossing, telling you where you're going. Safety develops through consistent modeling and gentle reminders, not one-time lessons.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes anxious or frightened when discussing safety topics

**Solution**: Stop immediately and provide reassurance. Use concrete, present-focused language: "Right now, you're safe. I'm here." Avoid hypothetical "what if" scenarios for anxious children. Focus on what you DO ("Here's what we do to stay safe") rather than what could happen. Spread safety learning across many short conversations rather than one activity. Some children learn better through play and lived experience without explicit discussion.

**Challenge**: Child seems bored or uninterested in safety discussions

**Solution**: Make it active and playful with less talking and more doing. Use role-play, movement, and props instead of conversation-based teaching. Incorporate safety into daily activities—practice holding your hand while walking, look both ways naturally when you cross streets, discuss safety rules as you do them. Some children internalize safety through repeated lived experience with gentle guidance rather than dedicated lessons.

**Challenge**: Child tests boundaries or ignores safety rules right after learning them

**Solution**: This is completely normal—young children need many repetitions to internalize rules and test limits to understand consequences. Stay patient and matter-of-fact. Re-teach gently: "Remember, we hold hands when crossing the street." Praise when rules are followed: "Yes! You looked both ways—that's safe!" Expect that their impulse control is still developing and constant reminders are appropriate and necessary.

**Challenge**: Child has experienced trauma or shows significant anxiety

**Solution**: Proceed carefully and consider consulting a therapist. For traumatized children, safety may be better taught through consistently keeping them safe rather than discussing dangers. Focus on present safety and trust: "Right now, you're safe with me." Avoid hypotheticals. Be available if they bring up fears, but don't initiate safety discussions. Their sense of safety develops from experiencing protective adults.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Review and Reinforce**: Periodically (every few weeks or when new situations arise) revisit key safety concepts through play and gentle conversation. Safety learning is ongoing throughout childhood.

2. **Document Progress**: Note in a journal or take photos of the child demonstrating safety skills (holding your hand crossing a street, practicing an emergency call, remembering a safety rule). Review periodically to celebrate growth.

3. **Create a Safety Resource Folder**: Keep printed emergency numbers, first aid basics, and safety information in one accessible place. Include pictures so young children can point to important information.
