# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Safety and Security Activities

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Through interactive play and exploration, children learn essential safety awareness and practical protective skills like recognizing safe situations, calling for help, and establishing secure spaces. Kids develop confidence and understanding of their environment while practicing safety skills in age-appropriate, non-threatening ways that empower rather than frighten them.

## Vocabulary

**Vigilance**: The practice of being alert and aware of what's happening around you. When you notice where you are and who is nearby, you're practicing vigilance—like noticing a car before you cross the street.

**Refuge**: A safe place where you can go to feel protected and calm. Your bedroom, a parent's arms, or a quiet corner can be a refuge when you need safety or comfort.

**Boundaries**: Invisible limits that protect what is yours and who you are. Your body belongs to you, and you get to decide who touches you—that's an important boundary.

**Resilience**: The strength and ability to recover when something difficult happens. When you practice what to do if you get scared or hurt, you're building resilience to handle challenges.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Baa, Baa, Black Sheep

**Tempo**: Slow and gentle

**Lyrics** (2 verses):

*Verse 1*
Safe, safe, always stay,
Close to grown-ups every day,
Hold a hand when we cross streets,
Look both ways, safe and neat,
Safe, safe, always stay,
Keeping danger far away.

*Verse 2*
When you're scared, use your voice,
Tell a grown-up—that's a choice,
Safe spaces help us rest,
Knowing safety is the best,
We are strong, we are brave,
Knowing how to keep us safe.

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Hold hands and sway side to side during verses
2. Look left and right (exaggerated head turns) at "look both ways"
3. Point to chest at "use your voice" and "we are strong"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children learn and practice essential safety skills through picture-based discussions, role-play scenarios, and hands-on exploration. They'll identify safe versus unsafe choices, practice calling for help, establish a personal safe space, and role-play with helpers, building competence and confidence in their ability to stay protected.

**Activity Type**: Role-play / Practical life skills demonstration / Social-emotional learning

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards showing safe vs. unsafe situations (8-10 images)—printed or hand-drawn
- Toy telephone or real phone for practice
- Blanket or cushions to create a "safe space"
- Dolls or stuffed animals for practicing safety scenarios

**Optional**:
- Safety signs (stop sign, caution, exit sign) for discussion
- Toy first aid kit with basic supplies
- Simple costume pieces (police hat, firefighter vest, doctor stethoscope)
- Flashlight for visibility discussion
- Traffic cones or tape for marking safe paths
- Children's books about personal safety

**Cost**: Free to $10 (most items are household items; books from library)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather picture cards showing 8-10 safety scenarios (holding hands while walking, saying "No" to strangers, crossing streets safely, fire safety, washing hands, etc.)
2. Prepare a comfortable, open space where children can move, sit, and talk freely
3. Set up toy phone or identify a real phone the child can practice with
4. Create a cozy "safe space" with a blanket or cushions in a quiet corner
5. Review all content to ensure it's age-appropriate and uses calm, reassuring language

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Sit comfortably with the child and introduce gently: "Today we're going to learn about ways to stay safe and healthy. Everyone wants to feel safe, right?" Use familiar examples: "When we hold hands while we cross the street, that keeps us safe. When we look both ways, that helps too!" Keep your tone positive and empowering, like learning helpful superhero skills.

2. **Picture Discussion** (5-7 min):
   Show picture cards one at a time. Ask open-ended questions: "What's happening here?" "Is this safe or unsafe?" "Why?" Discuss holding an adult's hand while walking, not talking to strangers, knowing emergency numbers, looking before crossing streets, and washing hands. Celebrate correct observations: "Yes! That's a safe choice! You noticed that!"

3. **Practice & Role-Play** (5-10 min):
   Choose one or two activities to practice:
   - **Calling for help**: Practice using a toy or real phone saying their name, that they need help, and their location
   - **Safe space**: Show the child the cozy blanket area and explain: "This is your safe space where you can go if you feel scared or need quiet time"
   - **Doll first aid**: Use stuffed animals to practice simple care (putting a band-aid on, getting help for someone who's hurt)
   - **Safety walk**: Create a simple path with tape or cones, walking together and stopping to discuss safe choices
   - **Helper role-play**: Act as a police officer, firefighter, or doctor while the child practices asking for help

4. **Free Exploration** (remaining time):
   Let the child choose which safety activity to practice again. Use props for continued role-play. If interested, play a simple "Can you remember?" game reviewing safe choices. Tell a story together about a character staying safe.

5. **Wrap-Up** (2-3 min):
   Summarize what you learned: "Today you learned about safe choices and practiced calling for help. You're so smart about safety!" Ask: "What was your favorite safe thing we practiced?" Connect to real life: "Tomorrow when we go to the park, we can practice looking both ways together." Praise their effort: "You did such a good job learning about safety today!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep explanations very simple and concrete: "Holding hands keeps us safe when we walk." Use only 2-3 picture cards to avoid overwhelm. Focus on physical safety (holding hands, staying close, not touching danger) rather than abstract concepts. Emphasize fun and playfulness over serious discussion. Practice through everyday moments: holding hands at the store, looking before stepping down, following you safely around the house. Use stuffed animals and dolls as main teaching tools—less direct pressure. Duration: 10-15 minutes or spread across several short 5-minute conversations throughout the day.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce more complex scenarios: what to do if lost in a store, basic fire safety, personal boundaries. Use more picture cards (8-10) covering traffic, strangers, home safety, and emergency numbers. Practice calling emergency numbers with a toy phone. Teach who "trusted adults" are. Create a simple safety rule chart together with pictures. Role-play realistic scenarios: "What if we get separated at the park?" Introduce body autonomy: "Your body is yours. Tell me if someone touches you in a way that doesn't feel good." Practice simple first aid: washing a scrape, finding a band-aid. Create a safety treasure hunt finding safe items around the house. Duration: 20-30 minutes.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Safety Hunt Around the Home
Walk through your home finding safety items on a checklist: fire extinguisher, first aid kit, emergency exits, phone, safe hiding place. Make it an adventure: "Can you find the first aid kit?"

**Variation 2**: Dress-Up as Safety Helpers
Provide costume pieces (police hat, firefighter vest, doctor stethoscope). Child role-plays being the helper while you need assistance. This reverses the power dynamic in a healthy, confidence-building way.

**Variation 3**: Create a Family Safety Book
Draw or print pictures showing your family's safety rules and emergency plans—where everyone meets if separated, emergency numbers, safe rooms in the house. Read it together regularly.

**Variation 4**: Community Helper Stories
If possible, have a police officer, firefighter, or paramedic briefly explain their safety role in age-appropriate terms. Children feel more empowered knowing helpers exist in their community.

**Variation 5**: Safety Rules Song
Create a simple tune and sing repeatedly about safety rules. Repetition through song aids memory and makes learning fun.

**Repeat play**: Children benefit from repeating safety learning across many days and situations. Practice during everyday activities—holding hands when walking, looking both ways before crossing, telling you where you're going. Safety develops through consistent modeling and gentle reminders, not one-time lessons.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes anxious or frightened when discussing safety topics

**Solution**: Stop immediately and provide reassurance. Use concrete, present-focused language: "Right now, you're safe. I'm here." Avoid hypothetical "what if" scenarios for anxious children. Focus on what you DO ("Here's what we do to stay safe") rather than what could happen. Spread safety learning across many short conversations rather than one activity. Some children learn better through play and lived experience without explicit discussion.

**Challenge**: Child seems bored or uninterested in safety discussions

**Solution**: Make it active and playful with less talking and more doing. Use role-play, movement, and props instead of conversation-based teaching. Incorporate safety into daily activities—practice holding your hand while walking, look both ways naturally when you cross streets, discuss safety rules as you do them. Some children internalize safety through repeated lived experience with gentle guidance rather than dedicated lessons.

**Challenge**: Child tests boundaries or ignores safety rules right after learning them

**Solution**: This is completely normal—young children need many repetitions to internalize rules and test limits to understand consequences. Stay patient and matter-of-fact. Re-teach gently: "Remember, we hold hands when crossing the street." Praise when rules are followed: "Yes! You looked both ways—that's safe!" Expect that their impulse control is still developing and constant reminders are appropriate and necessary.

**Challenge**: Child has experienced trauma or shows significant anxiety

**Solution**: Proceed carefully and consider consulting a therapist. For traumatized children, safety may be better taught through consistently keeping them safe rather than discussing dangers. Focus on present safety and trust: "Right now, you're safe with me." Avoid hypotheticals. Be available if they bring up fears, but don't initiate safety discussions. Their sense of safety develops from experiencing protective adults.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Review and Reinforce**: Periodically (every few weeks or when new situations arise) revisit key safety concepts through play and gentle conversation. Safety learning is ongoing throughout childhood.

2. **Document Progress**: Note in a journal or take photos of the child demonstrating safety skills (holding your hand crossing a street, practicing an emergency call, remembering a safety rule). Review periodically to celebrate growth.

3. **Create a Safety Resource Folder**: Keep printed emergency numbers, first aid basics, and safety information in one accessible place. Include pictures so young children can point to important information.
