# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Science Experiments and Discovery

## Activity Summary

Young scientists become experimenters as they conduct simple, hands-on investigations using everyday materials. Through mixing, pouring, observing, and predicting, children develop scientific thinking while discovering how things change, react, and transform. This activity builds curiosity, observation skills, and the confidence to ask questions about the world around them.

## Vocabulary

**Diffusion** (dih-fyoo-zhun): The movement of molecules from an area where there are many of them to an area where there are fewer — molecules always spread out to fill the available space. When a drop of food coloring enters water, diffusion is why the color slowly spreads outward in all directions without anyone stirring. "The color spreads because millions of tiny molecules are bumping into each other and moving outward — that's diffusion!"

**Molecule** (mol-eh-kyool): The smallest unit of a substance that still has its chemical properties. Water is made of water molecules (H₂O — two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom). Food coloring molecules are larger and have color because of how they absorb light. "Everything is made of molecules — tiny particles too small to see."

**Chemical reaction** (kem-ih-kul ree-ak-shun): When two substances combine and change into entirely new substances with different properties. The fizzing when baking soda meets vinegar is a chemical reaction: an acid (acetic acid in vinegar) reacts with a base (sodium bicarbonate = baking soda) and produces carbon dioxide gas, water, and sodium acetate. "The fizzing bubbles are carbon dioxide gas — a new substance that didn't exist before we mixed them!"

**Acid and base**: Two opposite types of chemical substances. Acids (like vinegar and lemon juice) have a sour taste and react energetically with bases. Bases (like baking soda) feel slightly slippery and have a bitter taste. When an acid meets a base, they neutralize each other — their opposite properties cancel out — and often produce new substances including gases. "Vinegar is an acid; baking soda is a base. When opposites meet, they react and release carbon dioxide bubbles!"

**Polarity** (poh-lair-ih-tee): A property of molecules that describes whether their electric charge is evenly distributed. Water molecules are polar — their charge is uneven — and oil molecules are nonpolar — their charge is even. Polar molecules attract other polar molecules; nonpolar attract nonpolar. That's why oil and water never mix: their molecular properties are incompatible. "Oil and water don't mix because their molecules don't like each other — they're polar and nonpolar!"

**Subtractive color mixing**: What happens when you mix pigments or dyes (like food coloring). Each pigment absorbs certain wavelengths of light and reflects others. When you mix yellow and blue pigments, the yellow absorbs blue light and the blue absorbs yellow light, so only green light reflects back to your eyes — the mixture appears green. This is different from mixing light (additive mixing). "When you mix paint colors, each pigment eats up more light wavelengths — the color you see is what's left over!"

**Hypothesis** (hy-poth-eh-sis): A prediction you make before doing an experiment — your best guess about what will happen, based on what you already know. Scientists always make a hypothesis before testing. "Before we mix the colors, let's make a hypothesis — what do you predict will happen?"

**Scientific method**: The process scientists use: Ask a question → Form a hypothesis → Do an experiment → Observe the results → Draw a conclusion. Even toddlers can follow this process: "What will happen? What do you think (hypothesis)? Let's try (experiment)! What happened (observation)? So now we know (conclusion)!"

## Learning Song

**Tune**: This Old Man

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Let's observe, let's observe
Watch the colors mix and swirl
We experiment and then discover
Things transform before our eyes
We observe, we discover
Science is so fun

*Verse 2*
Mix the red, mix the blue
Experiment with something new
We discover colors changing over
Watch them transform right away
We observe, we discover
Science every day

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Cup hands around eyes for "observe" and look around carefully
2. Make stirring motions with hands for "experiment" and "mix"
3. Spread hands apart with wonder for "discover" and "transform"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children conduct their own safe, simple science experiments using water, food coloring, and kitchen items. They'll mix, pour, observe color changes, and make predictions about what will happen next. This hands-on discovery activity develops the "scientist mindset" where curiosity, questioning, and observation are celebrated.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration and hands-on experimentation

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Clear containers or small clear bowls (plastic cups, glass bowls, or clear storage containers)
- Water
- Food coloring (multiple colors)
- Large shallow tray or baking pan to catch spills
- Small spoons or droppers for pouring
- Paper towels for cleanup

**Optional**:
- White vinegar and baking soda (for fizzing experiment)
- Dish soap
- Vegetable oil
- Clear glitter or small safe items to see through the colored water
- Pipettes or turkey basters for precision pouring
- Shallow sensory bins or water tables

**Cost**: Under $5 (most items are already in most households)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Fill containers with water (about 3-4 inches deep) and arrange them in the tray or on a covered surface
2. Pour small amounts of food coloring into separate cups or into squeeze bottles if available
3. Set out spoons, droppers, and paper towels within child's reach
4. Wear or prepare aprons to protect clothing from possible stains
5. Safety check: Ensure no food coloring or materials will be ingested; supervise closely

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction — The Scientific Method** (2-3 min):
   Introduce the scientific method by name, then follow it: "Scientists always start with a question and a hypothesis — a prediction. My question is: What will happen when we put food coloring in water? My hypothesis is: it will spread outward on its own. Let's find out!" Drop one drop of food coloring into clear still water. Watch it spread WITHOUT stirring. "The color is spreading on its own — that's diffusion! Millions of tiny molecules bumping each other and spreading outward. That is the same process happening in the ocean when dye spreads, in your bloodstream when nutrients spread, everywhere in nature!"

2. **Experiment 1: Diffusion and Subtractive Color Mixing** (4-6 min):
   Have the child form a hypothesis before each mix: "What do you predict will happen if we add yellow to the blue?" Say: "That's your hypothesis!" Then mix. Name what happens: "Red + yellow = orange because the yellow pigment absorbs blue light, the red absorbs green light, and only orange reflects back to our eyes — that's subtractive color mixing!" Try: red + blue = purple; blue + yellow = green. Each time: hypothesis first, then experiment, then name the result. "You followed the whole scientific method!"

3. **Experiment 2: Acid-Base Chemical Reaction** (4-6 min):
   Put baking soda (sodium bicarbonate — a base) in a cup. Form a hypothesis: "What will happen when we pour vinegar — an acid — on the baking soda?" Let the child pour the vinegar. Watch it fizz dramatically. Explain: "The vinegar is an acid; baking soda is a base. When acid meets base, a chemical reaction happens! The reaction produces carbon dioxide gas — CO2 — and that's what makes the bubbles! It's a completely new substance that didn't exist before. The acid and base neutralized each other." Add food coloring to make it colorful and visual. "Those bubbles are carbon dioxide — the same gas you breathe out, and the same gas in soda drinks!"

4. **Experiment 3: Oil and Water Polarity** (3-5 min, if time allows):
   Fill a clear jar or cup half with water, then add a splash of vegetable oil. Let the child shake it and watch. Form a hypothesis first: "What do you predict — will they mix or stay separate?" The oil always rises and separates. Explain: "Oil and water NEVER mix! Water molecules are polar — their electric charge is lopsided, like a magnet with two ends. Oil molecules are nonpolar — their charge is even. Polar molecules stick to polar; nonpolar stick to nonpolar. They literally repel each other! When you shook the jar, they were together for a second but immediately separated again." Add food coloring to the water layer to make the separation visible.

5. **Wrap-up — Draw a Conclusion** (2-3 min):
   Follow the scientific method to its end: "Now we draw conclusions! What did we discover? Diffusion spreads molecules without stirring. Acids and bases react to make carbon dioxide. Oil and water don't mix because of polarity. You did real science today — the same kind scientists do in real laboratories. What question do you want to test next?"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on 1-2 experiments with simple language but DO use the real vocabulary words — say "diffusion," "molecule," "chemical reaction." Toddlers won't fully understand but will absorb the words and concepts over time. Make it sensory and dramatic: "Watch the diffusion!" Focus on the color mixing experiment and the acid-base fizz (visually dramatic and exciting). Keep it to 10-12 minutes. For the hypothesis step, simplify to: "What do you think will happen?" (Accept any answer as valid.) Celebrate when the result matches or surprises: "You were right! / That was a surprise — let's find out why!"

**3-4+ years**:
Do all three experiments. Explicitly teach the scientific method: "Ask a question — form a hypothesis — experiment — observe — conclude." Have them say the names: "diffusion," "acid," "base," "carbon dioxide," "polarity." Ask "why" questions and wait for their hypotheses. Challenge them to design their own experiment: "What do you want to test? What's your hypothesis?" Introduce variables: "What would happen if we used hot water instead of cold? Would diffusion be faster or slower?" (Hint: warmer water = faster diffusion because molecules move faster at higher temperatures.) Allow 20+ minutes with independent experimentation.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Temperature and Diffusion Rate**: Fill two cups with water — one cold, one warm (not hot). Drop the same color into both at the same time and watch which spreads faster. "Molecules in warm water have more energy — they're moving faster — so they collide more often and diffusion happens faster. Temperature controls the speed of molecular movement!" This is a controlled experiment with one variable (temperature).

**Variation 2 - Density Layers (Rainbow in a Glass)**: Dissolve different amounts of sugar in water of different colors: lots of sugar in the bottom layer, less in the middle, none in the top. Carefully pour them to create stable colored layers. "Sugar dissolved in water makes it denser — heavier per unit of volume. Dense liquids sink below less dense ones, just like oil floats on water. This is a density column!" (Adult preparation required; demonstration experiment.)

**Variation 3 - Chromatography**: Place a coffee filter flat and put a single dot of washable black marker in the center. Drip water one drop at a time on the dot and watch the colors separate into rings. "Black ink is a mixture of many colored pigments blended together. Water carries each pigment molecule at a slightly different speed — lighter molecules travel farther — and the colors separate. This is called chromatography — how scientists identify unknown substances in labs!"

**Repeat play**: Each session, choose one real question to test. Keep a simple "science journal" — draw the hypothesis and result with crayon. Frame all of life as testable: "What happens if we add salt to water? Does ice change faster in air or water? Do heavier things fall faster?" Let their questions drive real experiments.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to drink the colored water or puts materials in their mouth
**Solution**: Use this as a teachable moment about safe materials. Have a designated "drinking water" cup separate from the experiment. Offer a snack or drink beforehand so thirst isn't a distraction. Redirect with enthusiasm: "This is for observing only! Let's use our eyes to watch the colors change." Supervise closely and use non-toxic food coloring only.

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated or wants to mix everything together into brown
**Solution**: This is completely normal and developmentally appropriate! Embrace it as part of their learning. Pour out the dirty water and start fresh with their permission. Use this as an opportunity to practice prediction and observation: "That made a brown color! What if we start again with just red and yellow?" Keep expectations low for "correct" results—the process and discovery matter more than outcomes.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or wants to move on
**Solution**: Younger children may have a 5-7 minute attention span for one activity. This is normal. Offer a different experiment variation (fizzy reaction, oil and water, adding glitter) or pause and resume later. Short, repeated sessions often work better than longer single sessions.

### Follow-Up Activities
1. **Pigment observation walk**: Look for colors in nature — blue from anthocyanin pigments, orange from carotenoids, green from chlorophyll. Point to a green leaf: "That's chlorophyll — the same molecule that captures sunlight to make food!" "Scientists observe nature and ask why."
2. **Chromatography with markers**: Lay a paper towel flat, draw colored marker dots, and drip water on each. Watch the pigments separate. "Each ink color is a mixture of pigments — water chromatography separates them!"
3. **Test the acid-base reaction further**: Taste a bit of lemon juice (acid) vs. baking soda dissolved in water (base, bitter). Then mix them together in the mouth or a cup — they neutralize each other and the fizzing stops. "Neutralization! The acid and base cancel each other out!"
4. **Daily hypotheses**: Each day at breakfast, ask: "What's one thing we could test today?" Keep a simple tally of hypotheses vs. results. Even "wrong" hypotheses are valuable: "Being wrong is how science works — that's how you learn what's actually true!"
