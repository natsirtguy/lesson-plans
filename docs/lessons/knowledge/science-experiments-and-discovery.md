# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Science Experiments and Discovery

## Activity Summary

Young scientists become experimenters as they conduct simple, hands-on investigations using everyday materials. Through mixing, pouring, observing, and predicting, children develop scientific thinking while discovering how things change, react, and transform. This activity builds curiosity, observation skills, and the confidence to ask questions about the world around them.

## Vocabulary

**Observe**: To watch something very carefully and notice what happens. When you observe, you use your eyes and senses to see colors, changes, and movements. "Let's observe what happens when we pour water into the dish."

**Experiment**: A special activity where you do something on purpose to see what will happen. You test an idea to discover something new. "We're going to experiment by mixing these two liquids together."

**Discover**: To find out or learn something for the first time that you didn't know before. "When you mix blue paint and yellow paint, you'll discover a brand new color!"

**Transform**: To change something into a different form or appearance. When something transforms, it becomes something new or different from before. "Watch how the ice will transform into water when we leave it in the sun."

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children conduct their own safe, simple science experiments using water, food coloring, and kitchen items. They'll mix, pour, observe color changes, and make predictions about what will happen next. This hands-on discovery activity develops the "scientist mindset" where curiosity, questioning, and observation are celebrated.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration and hands-on experimentation

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Clear containers or small clear bowls (plastic cups, glass bowls, or clear storage containers)
- Water
- Food coloring (multiple colors)
- Large shallow tray or baking pan to catch spills
- Small spoons or droppers for pouring
- Paper towels for cleanup

**Optional**:
- White vinegar and baking soda (for fizzing experiment)
- Dish soap
- Vegetable oil
- Clear glitter or small safe items to see through the colored water
- Pipettes or turkey basters for precision pouring
- Shallow sensory bins or water tables

**Cost**: Under $5 (most items are already in most households)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Fill containers with water (about 3-4 inches deep) and arrange them in the tray or on a covered surface
2. Pour small amounts of food coloring into separate cups or into squeeze bottles if available
3. Set out spoons, droppers, and paper towels within child's reach
4. Wear or prepare aprons to protect clothing from possible stains
5. Safety check: Ensure no food coloring or materials will be ingested; supervise closely

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Gather near the water containers and ask: "What do you think will happen if we add colors to the water?" Show one drop of food coloring falling into clear water. Say: "Look! The color is moving through the water! Let's discover what happens with more colors."

2. **Exploration** (8-12 min):
   Let the child drop food coloring into the water containers, stir with spoons, pour water from one container to another, and mix colors together. Discover what happens. Ask open-ended questions: "What colors are you making?" "What happens when you stir?" "Can you make a new color?" Encourage them to predict before mixing ("What do you think will happen if we add red to the yellow?").

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Point out the color changes and transformations: "You discovered that red and yellow make orange!" Ask questions about what they notice: "Which color spread the fastest?" "Can you make the same color again?" Let them continue experimenting or introduce a new variable (adding soap, oil, or glitter to a fresh container).

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Celebrate their discoveries: "You were such a good scientist today! You tested colors, mixed them together, and discovered new colors. Scientists do exactly this—they try things, watch what happens, and learn something new!" Discuss what their favorite discovery was.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep it simple with just 2-3 colors at a time. Focus on the sensory experience of pouring, stirring, and watching colors spread. Use larger containers and spoons that are easier to handle. Demonstrate each action first, then let them copy. Use simple language: "Look! The water changed colors!" Shorter duration (10-12 minutes). Avoid small loose items that might be choking hazards.

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce color mixing with prediction: "What color do you think we'll make?" Challenge them to recreate colors or make all the colors of the rainbow. Expand to additional experiments (baking soda and vinegar fizzing, oil and water separation, adding glitter or objects to observe through colored water). Ask "why" questions and encourage scientific thinking. Introduce the vocabulary words naturally: "Let's observe what happens." "Can you predict what color we'll discover?" Allow longer exploration time (15-20 minutes) with more independent experimentation.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Fizzy Reaction**: Add a teaspoon of baking soda to a container of water, then add a few drops of food coloring. Pour in a splash of white vinegar to watch the fizzing and color change. This introduces cause-and-effect and chemical reactions in a safe, exciting way.

**Variation 2 - Rainbow Layers**: Use oil and water in the same container. Add different colored food coloring drops to see how they behave in the oil versus the water, creating colorful layers. This demonstrates how different liquids interact.

**Repeat play**: Rotate colors, use different sized containers, create new combinations, or let them "teach" you or a stuffed animal how to do a science experiment. Each session will reveal something new as they ask different questions and make new predictions.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to drink the colored water or puts materials in their mouth
**Solution**: Use this as a teachable moment about safe materials. Have a designated "drinking water" cup separate from the experiment. Offer a snack or drink beforehand so thirst isn't a distraction. Redirect with enthusiasm: "This is for observing only! Let's use our eyes to watch the colors change." Supervise closely and use non-toxic food coloring only.

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated or wants to mix everything together into brown
**Solution**: This is completely normal and developmentally appropriate! Embrace it as part of their learning. Pour out the dirty water and start fresh with their permission. Use this as an opportunity to practice prediction and observation: "That made a brown color! What if we start again with just red and yellow?" Keep expectations low for "correct" results—the process and discovery matter more than outcomes.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or wants to move on
**Solution**: Younger children may have a 5-7 minute attention span for one activity. This is normal. Offer a different experiment variation (fizzy reaction, oil and water, adding glitter) or pause and resume later. Short, repeated sessions often work better than longer single sessions.

### Follow-Up Activities
1. **Color hunt walk**: Take a walk outside and look for colors they discovered (blue, purple, orange). Point out how nature has all these colors. "Scientists observe nature too!"
2. **Paint or draw with water colors**: Let them mix water colors and paint, reinforcing color mixing and discovery.
3. **Sensory bottles**: Create permanent sensory bottles with colored water, glitter, and oil sealed in plastic bottles for ongoing observation.
4. **Ask and investigate**: Encourage them to ask "what if" questions throughout the day and try small experiments at home ("What happens if we add salt to water?" "Does ice change if we leave it out?"). Frame all of life as an opportunity for scientific discovery.
