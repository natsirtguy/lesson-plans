# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Show and Tell Presentations

## Activity Summary

Show and tell is an exercise in one of the hardest communication challenges: explaining something familiar to you to someone who has never seen it. To do this well, children have to practice **perspective-taking** — understanding that the audience doesn't know what they know. This is a real cognitive milestone. Very young children (under 2) assume everyone shares their knowledge; by ages 3-4, children begin to develop "audience awareness" — they start to understand that a stranger needs more description than a close family member. This developmental shift is part of **theory of mind** (understanding that other people have different knowledge and perspectives). Show-and-tell makes this concrete and practicing it accelerates oral narrative skills, which are directly linked to later reading comprehension and writing ability.

## Vocabulary

**Perspective-taking**: Imagining what another person knows or doesn't know, sees or can't see, from their point of view. When presenting, you have to think: "What does my audience already know about this object? What do I need to explain?"

**Theory of mind**: The ability to understand that other people have their own thoughts, knowledge, and beliefs that may be different from yours. Show-and-tell exercises theory of mind because you have to think about what your audience doesn't know.

**Oral narrative**: A spoken story or description that has a beginning, middle, and enough information for someone unfamiliar with the topic to follow. "I like it" is not a narrative; "It's soft and blue, I got it when I was a baby, and it goes everywhere with me" is an oral narrative.

**Descriptive language**: Using specific words that give the listener a real picture: color, texture, size, shape, sound, smell. "It's nice" is not descriptive; "it's bumpy and bright orange and makes a rattling sound" is descriptive.

**Audience awareness**: Adjusting how you explain something based on who is listening and what they already know. A good communicator speaks differently to someone who has never seen something than to someone who is familiar with it.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Cheerful and encouraging

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
When I present something special
I show my audience
With confidence I hold it up
This thing that's special to me
I present here, present there
Show my audience with care
With confidence I share something special
For all to see

*Verse 2*
The audience watches closely now
I present with pride
My special toy is shown to all
With confidence inside
Present here, present there
My audience is everywhere
With confidence I show my special things
I do not hide

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Hold up an imaginary object proudly for "present" and "special"
2. Gesture to others around for "audience"
3. Stand tall with chest out for "confidence"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children select a special object and practice describing it to an audience who cannot fully see or understand it. The key challenge to introduce: **your audience doesn't know your object the way you do** — so you have to find words that help them understand. Caregivers should name this explicitly: "Pretend I've never seen this before. What words would help me understand it without touching it?" This is perspective-taking in action, and it can be introduced as exactly that: "You're using your imagination to think about what I know and don't know. That's called perspective-taking — and it's one of the most important skills in communication."

**Activity Type**: Interactive presentation and communication practice

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- A special object or toy brought by child (or selected from classroom collection)
- Small group of 3-5 children (or just parent/caregiver for one-on-one)
- Comfortable sitting area (circle or semicircle arrangement)

**Optional**:
- Simple certificate or sticker for "Great Presenter"
- Picture cards to help prompt descriptions
- Clipboard and paper for peer comments/drawings

**Cost**: Free (uses items already available)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather the small group in a comfortable circle where everyone can see the presenter
2. Help the child select or bring their special object (could be a favorite toy, blanket, book, etc.)
3. Remind children that this is a time to listen carefully and be kind

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Explain: "Today we're doing show and tell. That means one person shows us something special and tells us about it, and the rest of us listen and ask questions."
   - Model the behavior yourself first: hold up an object, tell them why you like it, and answer a question about it
   - This gives children a clear example of what's expected

2. **Presentation** (5-8 min):
   - Invite the first child to stand or sit in the center with their object
   - Before they start, set up the perspective-taking challenge: "Pretend I've never seen this before in my life. How would you help me understand it?"
   - Encourage them to use descriptive language: color, texture, size, sound, what it does
   - When they say something vague ("it's nice"), prompt: "What does 'nice' mean for this object? Nice to touch? Nice to look at?"
   - When they use precise language, name it: "You said 'bumpy' — that's a really descriptive word. Now I can picture it."
   - Keep it simple — even one specific sentence is a successful presentation for younger children

3. **Audience Participation** (3-5 min):
   - Teach the group that good questions help the presenter explain more:
     - "What does it feel like?"
     - "Where does it come from?"
     - "Can you show us how it works?"
   - After the presentation, ask the audience: "What do you know about this object now that you didn't know before? What helped you understand it?"
   - This closes the perspective-taking loop — children can see how description actually transfers knowledge

4. **Wrap-up** (2 min):
   - Thank the presenter
   - If there are other children, rotate: "Who's next?"
   - End with applause or a simple celebration
   - Transition by saying: "You were all such good listeners!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Keep presentations very short (30 seconds - 1 minute max)
- Accept non-verbal presentations (just showing and letting others touch/explore)
- You do most of the talking: "Look at Maya's teddy bear. It's soft and brown. Maya loves to hug it"
- Reduce audience to just 1-2 familiar people
- Let them sit in your lap while presenting if they're shy
- Focus more on the object itself than detailed descriptions

**3-4+ years**:
- Encourage 2-3 sentences with specific descriptive language
- Introduce the perspective-taking challenge explicitly: "Your audience has never seen this. What do they need to know?" then after: "Did your description give them enough to picture it?"
- Ask follow-up questions that push for precision: "You said it's big — bigger than your hand? Bigger than a chair?"
- Practice the "blind description" game: hide the object behind your back, the child describes it from memory, then reveal it — did the description match?
- Ask them to identify what the audience knows versus what they had to explain: "Before you talked, what did we know? What do we know now?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - "Guess the Object"**: Place a special object in a bag. The presenter gives clues without showing it, and the audience guesses what it is. Then reveal the object.

**Variation 2 - "Story Show and Tell"**: Instead of just describing the object, the child tells a story about it: "I got this toy when..." or "One time I used this and..."

**Repeat play**:
- Do show and tell weekly with different children so everyone gets a turn
- Let children present the same object multiple times to build confidence
- Create a "special items basket" where children can choose different objects to present
- Take photos of each presentation and create a "Show and Tell" memory book

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is shy or doesn't want to present in front of others
**Solution**: Start with very small groups (just you and one other trusted person). Let them present to just a stuffed animal or pet first. Gradually increase the audience size. Never force a presentation—confidence builds naturally with repetition. Sometimes sitting in your lap while presenting helps younger children feel safe.

**Challenge**: Child talks too fast or mumbles/isn't clear
**Solution**: Model slow, clear speech when you present first. Gently remind: "Can you say that again, a bit slower? I want to hear all about it." This is natural at this age—clear speech develops over time. The goal is communication, not perfection.

**Challenge**: Child describes object in vague terms or runs out of things to say
**Solution**: Ask open-ended questions to help them think and talk more: "Tell me more about that. What does it feel like?" "Why do you like playing with it?" "What's your favorite color on it?" These questions help expand their thinking and speaking.

**Challenge**: Other children interrupt or don't listen politely
**Solution**: Teach listening skills explicitly before presentations: "When someone is presenting, we look at them, listen quietly, and wait our turn to talk." Praise children when they listen well: "I saw you were such a good listener!" Model good listening yourself.

**Challenge**: Child gets upset if someone doesn't react the way they wanted
**Solution**: Talk about feelings ahead of time: "Everyone will listen to you because you're sharing something cool. Some people might ask questions, some might smile, everyone will be kind." Help them understand that different reactions are okay. Practice being a supportive audience yourself.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Drawing & Remembering**: After presentations, children can draw the objects they heard about from other children to practice remembering and listening

2. **Create a Show and Tell Display**: Display photos of each presentation on a bulletin board or create a memory book so children can review and celebrate each other's sharing

3. **Everyday Presentations**: Extend the skill to other areas—let them "present" during snack time (tell about their lunch), show you something they made, or describe an experience they had. This helps them practice the skill in natural ways
