# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Show and Tell Presentations

## Activity Summary

Children learn to share special items with others through simple presentations, developing communication skills, confidence, and social connection. This activity helps children practice speaking about objects they care about while learning to listen and show interest in their peers' experiences.

## Vocabulary

**Present**: To show or share something with other people; when you stand up and let everyone see your toy, you are presenting it.

**Audience**: The group of people who are watching and listening to you; your friends and teachers are your audience when you do show and tell.

**Confidence**: Feeling sure and brave about what you're doing; showing your favorite toy takes confidence because you're being brave in front of your friends.

**Special**: Something that is important, unique, or more valuable than other things; your favorite stuffed animal is special because it means a lot to you and makes you happy.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Cheerful and encouraging

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
When I present something special
I show my audience
With confidence I hold it up
This thing that's special to me
I present here, present there
Show my audience with care
With confidence I share something special
For all to see

*Verse 2*
The audience watches closely now
I present with pride
My special toy is shown to all
With confidence inside
Present here, present there
My audience is everywhere
With confidence I show my special things
I do not hide

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Hold up an imaginary object proudly for "present" and "special"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children select a special object and practice presenting it to a small group. They learn to describe their item, explain why it's special, and present with confidence while peers practice listening and asking questions.

**Activity Type**: Interactive presentation and communication practice

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- A special object or toy brought by child (or selected from classroom collection)
- Small group of 3-5 children (or just parent/caregiver for one-on-one)
- Comfortable sitting area (circle or semicircle arrangement)

**Optional**:
- Simple certificate or sticker for "Great Presenter"
- Picture cards to help prompt descriptions
- Clipboard and paper for peer comments/drawings

**Cost**: Free (uses items already available)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather the small group in a comfortable circle where everyone can see the presenter
2. Help the child select or bring their special object (could be a favorite toy, blanket, book, etc.)
3. Remind children that this is a time to listen carefully and be kind

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Explain: "Today we're doing show and tell. That means one person shows us something special and tells us about it, and the rest of us listen and ask questions."
   - Model the behavior yourself first: hold up an object, tell them why you like it, and answer a question about it
   - This gives children a clear example of what's expected

2. **Presentation** (5-8 min):
   - Invite the first child to stand or sit in the center with their object
   - Encourage them to:
     - Hold the object so everyone can see it clearly
     - Tell the group: "This is my [object name]"
     - Say one or two things they like about it or why it's special
     - Describe how it feels, looks, or what you do with it
   - Keep it simple—even one sentence is a successful presentation for younger children

3. **Audience Participation** (3-5 min):
   - Teach the group to ask kind questions:
     - "What do you like about it?"
     - "What color is it?"
     - "Can you play with it?"
   - Model asking respectful questions yourself
   - Teach children to listen without interrupting
   - Praise the presenter: "Great job telling us about your toy!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2 min):
   - Thank the presenter
   - If there are other children, rotate: "Who's next?"
   - End with applause or a simple celebration
   - Transition by saying: "You were all such good listeners!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Keep presentations very short (30 seconds - 1 minute max)
- Accept non-verbal presentations (just showing and letting others touch/explore)
- You do most of the talking: "Look at Maya's teddy bear. It's soft and brown. Maya loves to hug it"
- Reduce audience to just 1-2 familiar people
- Let them sit in your lap while presenting if they're shy
- Focus more on the object itself than detailed descriptions

**3-4+ years**:
- Encourage children to say 2-3 sentences about their item
- Ask follow-up questions to deepen thinking: "Why is that your favorite?" "How does it make you feel?"
- Teach them to make eye contact with the audience
- Practice the presentation once before the "real" show and tell
- Encourage them to pass their object around so others can see details
- Teach hand-raising to ask questions
- Talk about being a "good listener" (looking at the presenter, being quiet, etc.)

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - "Guess the Object"**: Place a special object in a bag. The presenter gives clues without showing it, and the audience guesses what it is. Then reveal the object.

**Variation 2 - "Story Show and Tell"**: Instead of just describing the object, the child tells a story about it: "I got this toy when..." or "One time I used this and..."

**Repeat play**:
- Do show and tell weekly with different children so everyone gets a turn
- Let children present the same object multiple times to build confidence
- Create a "special items basket" where children can choose different objects to present
- Take photos of each presentation and create a "Show and Tell" memory book

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is shy or doesn't want to present in front of others
**Solution**: Start with very small groups (just you and one other trusted person). Let them present to just a stuffed animal or pet first. Gradually increase the audience size. Never force a presentation—confidence builds naturally with repetition. Sometimes sitting in your lap while presenting helps younger children feel safe.

**Challenge**: Child talks too fast or mumbles/isn't clear
**Solution**: Model slow, clear speech when you present first. Gently remind: "Can you say that again, a bit slower? I want to hear all about it." This is natural at this age—clear speech develops over time. The goal is communication, not perfection.

**Challenge**: Child describes object in vague terms or runs out of things to say
**Solution**: Ask open-ended questions to help them think and talk more: "Tell me more about that. What does it feel like?" "Why do you like playing with it?" "What's your favorite color on it?" These questions help expand their thinking and speaking.

**Challenge**: Other children interrupt or don't listen politely
**Solution**: Teach listening skills explicitly before presentations: "When someone is presenting, we look at them, listen quietly, and wait our turn to talk." Praise children when they listen well: "I saw you were such a good listener!" Model good listening yourself.

**Challenge**: Child gets upset if someone doesn't react the way they wanted
**Solution**: Talk about feelings ahead of time: "Everyone will listen to you because you're sharing something cool. Some people might ask questions, some might smile, everyone will be kind." Help them understand that different reactions are okay. Practice being a supportive audience yourself.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Drawing & Remembering**: After presentations, children can draw the objects they heard about from other children to practice remembering and listening

2. **Create a Show and Tell Display**: Display photos of each presentation on a bulletin board or create a memory book so children can review and celebrate each other's sharing

3. **Everyday Presentations**: Extend the skill to other areas—let them "present" during snack time (tell about their lunch), show you something they made, or describe an experience they had. This helps them practice the skill in natural ways
