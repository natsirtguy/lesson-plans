# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Sign Language and Gesture Games

## 🎯 Activity Summary

This activity introduces children to non-verbal communication through sign language and gesture-based games, building awareness that people communicate in many different ways beyond spoken words. Children learn simple signs, create their own gestures, and play interactive games that develop body awareness, attention to detail, and inclusive communication skills.

## Vocabulary

**Non-verbal Communication**: Sharing meaning and ideas without using spoken words. For example, waving your hand to say goodbye, or nodding your head to say yes.

**Gesture**: A movement of your hands, arms, body, or head that shows what you mean or how you feel. For example, clapping your hands to show you're happy.

**Expression**: Showing your feelings or thoughts through your face and body movements. When you smile big and jump up and down, you're expressing that you're excited.

**Inclusive**: Making a space where all people feel welcome and able to join in, even if they communicate or move in different ways.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Baa, Baa, Black Sheep

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics**

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore non-verbal communication by learning simple signs, making gestures, and playing interactive guessing games. Through imitation, creation, and play-based learning, children discover that there are many ways to express ideas and feelings beyond words. This builds body awareness, observation skills, and understanding of inclusive communication.

**Activity Type**: Social and cultural communication practice, movement exploration

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: Minimal (2-5 minutes)

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Your own hands and body (no other materials required)
- Clear space (5 x 5 feet minimum for safe movement)
- Good lighting so hand shapes are visible

**Optional**:
- Body-length mirror to see gestures
- Picture cards showing simple signs (animals, greetings, emotions)
- Scarves or ribbons for following during movement games
- Toy animals to sign about

**Cost**: Free

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Clear the space of obstacles and hazards
2. Arrange so all children can see your face and hands clearly (semi-circle seating is ideal)
3. Practice 3-4 simple signs beforehand (HELLO, THANK YOU, MORE, HAPPY are good starters)
4. Ensure good lighting and consider positioning near a mirror if available

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):

   Start with hands behind your back and get children's attention through facial expression and eye contact. Show your hands with an excited gesture (both hands opening upward). Say: "Today we're going to learn a fun way to talk with our hands and bodies - using signs and silly gestures! We don't have to say words. We can tell stories and play games just by moving."

   Demonstrate one simple sign like HELLO (just wave your hand). Explain: "When I show you a sign or gesture, watch carefully with your eyes and your body. There's no 'right way' - everyone's signs can look a little different, and that's wonderful."

2. **Exploration** (5-10 minutes):

   Introduce one sign at a time, starting with 3-4 signs total. Demonstrate the sign slowly, showing hand shape, position, and movement. Invite children to copy: "Now it's your turn - can you make your hands look like mine?"

   **Simple signs to teach**:
   - **HELLO**: Wave hand at side of head
   - **THANK YOU**: Place fingertips on chin, move hand outward/downward
   - **MORE**: Tap fingertips together (both hands)
   - **HAPPY**: Move open hands upward on chest
   - **CAT**: Draw whiskers from cheeks with index and middle fingers
   - **DOG**: Snap fingers while patting leg

   Comment on what you observe: "I see your hands moving up and down, just like HAPPY! That's the sign for happy!" Allow 30-60 seconds per sign for practice. Repeat signs if children request them.

3. **Discovery** (5-10 minutes):

   Play interactive gesture games:

   **Game 1: Sign Story** - Make 3-4 simple signs in sequence (HELLO, CAT, HAPPY, FRIEND). Invite children to copy the sequence with you. Gradually add exaggerated gestures and create silly combinations.

   **Game 2: Guess the Gesture** - Make a simple, exaggerated gesture (large circle with arms, pretend eating, big yawn). Ask: "What am I doing? Can you show me too?" Accept various interpretations and celebrate all attempts.

   **Game 3: Copy and Change** - Make a simple gesture. Child copies it. You change one thing (turn hand, make it slower, higher or lower). Child copies the new version. This builds observation skills.

   **Game 4: Emotion Gestures** - Show happy (smile + hands up), sad (frown + hands down), excited (jumping + arms up), tired (yawn + slow movements). Children copy each emotion. Ask: "Can you show me a happy face with your hands?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):

   Gather children together and say: "We learned so many ways to talk without using words!" Sign or gesture a few of the learned signs. Ask: "Which sign or gesture was your favorite?" (Allow verbal or gesture responses). Closure: "Our hands and bodies can tell stories and share how we feel. That's pretty amazing!" Transition using signs: "HELLO (wave) to playtime!" or incorporate signs into transitions.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:

Focus on very simple, large gestures and one or two signs. Use lots of repetition with familiar routines. Pair signs with spoken words (don't replace speech). Keep games very short (2-3 minutes each). Accept that many children will watch rather than participate at first. Use exaggerated facial expressions and movements for clarity. Focus on animal signs (CAT, DOG, BIRD) as they're concrete and engaging. Reduce overall duration to 10-15 minutes with more frequent breaks. Model every gesture and sign multiple times. Use hand-over-hand guidance gently if the child is comfortable.

**3-4+ years**:

Introduce 5-7 signs instead of 3-4. Create sign sentences (HELLO + NAME + HOW ARE YOU). Play more complex games like Hide and Guess (hide action, children guess what it was). Introduce emotion signs and discuss feelings in detail. Create gesture stories with beginning, middle, and end. Encourage children to teach signs to peers. Ask children to describe what others' gestures mean. Introduce directional signs (signs that move toward or away from body). Connect to literacy by pairing signs with letters and words. Extend duration to 20-25 minutes as they can sustain longer engagement.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Animal Sign Game** - Learn signs for 4-5 animals (CAT, DOG, BIRD, FISH, BEAR). Create a sequence or story using animal signs. Make animal movement gestures to go with signs (hop for bunny, swim for fish). Play "What Animal Am I?" where children guess the animal from gestures.

**Variation 2: Emotion and Feeling Signs** - Learn signs for HAPPY, SAD, ANGRY, TIRED, SILLY, SCARED. Create an Emotion Mirror game where children show how their body looks when feeling different emotions. Read a picture book and have children sign the emotion of the character. Create an emotion wheel with gestures instead of words.

**Variation 3: Whole Body Story Gestures** - Create a story using large, full-body movements and signs combined. Example sequence: "HELLO friends, WALK to the BEACH, SWIM in WATER, PLAY TOGETHER, GOODBYE." Invite children to add movements and remember the sequence across sessions.

**Repeat play**: Gesture games get better and easier with repetition. Replay favorite games many times. Teach family members the signs learned so children reinforce learning at home. Use signs during daily routines and transitions. Build a family "sign language" with made-up signs together.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't want to participate or feels shy about gestures.

**Solution**: Never force participation. Celebrate watching: "Thank you for watching so carefully!" Invite participation without pressure by saying "When you're ready, you can show me a sign." Start with very small movements. Do the activity side-by-side so they're not the center of attention. Let them lead - if they show a gesture first, copy them enthusiastically.

**Challenge**: Children get giggly or silly with gestures and don't take it seriously.

**Solution**: Embrace the silliness - silly IS learning! Laughter helps children remember. Guide the silliness toward the activity by saying "Let's make our HAPPY sign really, really big and silly!" Silliness builds confidence to try new movements.

**Challenge**: Adult worries about teaching signs incorrectly or inaccurately.

**Solution**: This activity is about introducing gesture and communication concepts, not achieving ASL fluency. Approximate signs work fine and are developmentally appropriate. If you want more accuracy, research one sign at a time from reliable sources like Signing Savvy website or local Deaf organizations. Remember that the activity focuses on communication, movement, and inclusion rather than perfect hand shapes.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Use signs in daily transitions**: Say "HELLO, friends! Time to CLEAN UP" while signing during routines. This reinforces learning naturally and shows signs in meaningful contexts.

2. **Family sign-teaching**: Encourage children to teach family members the signs they learned. Create a family "sign language" with made-up signs together to build inside jokes and connections.

3. **Connection to daily life**: Watch "Goodnight Moon" in ASL on YouTube with your child, or explore picture books about sign language. Discuss how different people communicate in different ways. If possible, arrange a visit from a Deaf or hard of hearing community member to share authentic sign language experiences.
