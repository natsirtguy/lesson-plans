# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Simple Video Creation and Recording

## Activity Summary

Children will explore the basics of creating and recording videos using simple devices like phones or tablets, learning about how to capture movement, faces, and activities. Through hands-on recording and playback experiences, children develop digital literacy, self-awareness, and creative expression while understanding the technology that surrounds them.

## Vocabulary

**Record**: To capture an action or moment by pressing a button on a camera or video device so you can watch it again later. When you record your friends dancing, you can press play and see them dance again.

**Playback**: Playing back means watching or listening to something you recorded. After you press stop on the camera, you can press play to watch your video right away.

**Frame**: The area you see through the camera or video screen. A frame is everything the camera can see—the people, toys, and things in front of it. When you point the camera at your friend's face, their face fills the frame.

**Capture**: To catch or save a moment or movement by recording it with a camera. When you capture someone jumping, you save that jump forever on the video so you can watch it again and again.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
When we record a video now
We capture what we do
Point the camera at the frame
And playback starts for you
With a record here and capture there
Here we frame, there we frame
Everywhere we playback now
We watch the video

*Verse 2*
Press the button, start record
Capture all the fun
See the playback on the screen
The frame shows everyone
With a record here and playback there
Here we capture, there we frame
Making videos every day
We record and play

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Hold hands up like holding a camera for "record" and "frame"
2. Press thumb down for pressing the record button to "capture"
3. Make a rectangle with fingers for "playback" and pretend to watch the screen

## Intro Video Recommendation

**Recommended video**: Search for: "Learning to record videos for preschoolers" or "How to use a phone camera for kids"

**What to look for**:
- 2-5 minutes long
- Shows children or adults recording simple activities like playing or dancing
- Clear, slow narration explaining what's happening
- Visually engaging with bright colors and movement
- Focuses on the process (press here, point there) rather than technical details
- Shows the finished video being played back so children understand the connection

**Alternative searches**:
- "Recording yourself with a tablet preschool"
- "Simple video recording for young children"
- "Phone camera activities for toddlers"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will use a smartphone or tablet to record short videos of themselves, friends, or activities happening around them. They'll learn how to point the camera, press the recording button, and watch what they've created. This hands-on exploration builds digital confidence and creates a record of their play and movement.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on demonstration and exploration

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Smartphone or tablet with a camera
- A safe, open space for recording
- Natural or adequate lighting

**Optional**:
- Small props (stuffed animals, scarves, simple toys)
- Colorful backdrop (blanket or wall)
- Headphones or speakers for playback

**Cost**: Free (uses device you already have)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Charge recording device fully and check storage space
2. Clear performance area of hazards and clutter
3. Ensure adequate lighting (near a window or with lights on)
4. Test recording and playback functions before starting

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Gather the child and explain what you're going to do: "We're going to be video makers today! We're going to press this button to record, and then we can watch ourselves doing silly things." Show them the phone or tablet and point to the record button. Let them hold it and feel comfortable with it. You might demonstrate by recording a quick video of yourself making a funny face, then play it back and say, "Look! There I am!"

2. **Exploration** (8-12 minutes):
   Start by recording something simple: the child waving at the camera, jumping, dancing, or playing with a toy. Keep recordings short (10-30 seconds). After each recording, immediately play it back so they see themselves. Say things like, "Look! There you are waving! You did that!" This connection between action and playback is crucial for understanding what recording means. Record multiple short clips: jumping, making funny faces, moving a toy, spinning around, playing peek-a-boo. Celebrate each recording enthusiastically. If the child is interested, let them try to hold and point the camera at you, a sibling, or a toy, with your gentle guidance.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   Ask questions as you watch playback together: "What are you doing in this video? Can you do it again and make a new one?" Point out details: "Look at your smile! Your arms are moving so fast!" Ask the child to notice differences between videos: "What were you wearing in that one? What toys were in the video?" If the child is comfortable, watch 2-3 videos in a row so they see the collection of things they've created together.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   "You're such a great video maker! You recorded videos of yourself and we got to watch them. Wasn't that fun?" Save the videos or transfer them to a safe place (cloud storage or computer) so they're not accidentally deleted. Transition to the next activity with: "Let's go play something else now, and maybe we can make more videos another day!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep it very simple and concrete. Use one device (yours) and do all the recording yourself. Focus on helping them see themselves in playback—this is new and exciting for this age. Make recordings very short (under 15 seconds). Use very simple language: "Record!" and "Watch!" Let them tap or press the button with your hand over theirs. Accept very short clips and messy, unfocused recordings as completely normal and wonderful.

**3-4+ years**:
Give more independence. Let them try holding the device with supervision. Ask them to decide what to record: "What should we film next?" Encourage them to pose or perform for the camera. Make slightly longer recordings (up to 30 seconds). Ask more reflective questions during playback: "What were you doing? What happens next in the video?" They may be interested in creating simple narratives or stories with their recordings.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Story Videos**: Have the child act out a simple story (e.g., a teddy bear going to sleep, a toy going for a walk) and record the whole sequence. Watch it together as a "movie."

**Variation 2 - Nature Documentary**: Go outside and record nature—birds, trees moving in wind, water, shadows, insects. Create a nature video collection and narrate it like you're describing what you see.

**Variation 3 - Prop Theater**: Child selects props or toys and films a performance with them. Record the toy "talking" or "performing" while they operate it.

**Repeat Play**: Each time you record, it creates a little memory. Over several days, you can build a collection of videos showing the child's movements and growth. Watching old videos alongside new ones helps them see how they're changing and developing.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: The child is afraid of the camera or won't look at it.
**Solution**: Don't force it. Start by recording other things (toys, the floor, walls) while the child watches. Let them get comfortable with the camera before being the focus. Sometimes recording from behind or from the side feels less intimidating than facing the camera directly. Be patient—self-consciousness typically fades with repeated, low-pressure exposure.

**Challenge**: The child wants to watch the video immediately and won't do other recordings.
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal—the immediate feedback loop is very engaging! Take very short clips (10-15 seconds) and pause frequently to replay. This maintains engagement and allows celebration of what was captured. Accept that multiple short videos may be preferable to one long recording.

**Challenge**: The child is too self-conscious or won't perform for the camera.
**Solution**: Record candid moments instead—them playing naturally, not "performing." Or record yourself being silly first so they see adults can be goofy on video. Filming their toys or activities rather than focusing on them directly can also help them feel more comfortable.

**Challenge**: Device battery drains quickly or storage fills up.
**Solution**: Charge device fully before the activity. Transfer or delete old videos to a computer or cloud storage to free up space. Consider shorter recording sessions if battery is a concern. Always have a backup plan if technology fails—pivot to another creative activity.

### Follow-Up Activities
1. Create a "video library" by organizing recordings into folders (one folder per week, or by activity type like "dancing videos," "toy videos," "nature videos")
2. Show recordings to family members (grandparents, siblings) for celebrations and validation
3. Compare videos over time—record the same action each week and watch how the child's movements, coordination, and confidence change and develop
4. Keep a few favorite videos to show child's progression over months or years
