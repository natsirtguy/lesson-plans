# Knowledge, Skills & Culture: Sink or Float Experiments

## Activity Summary

Children explore the concept of buoyancy by discovering which objects float and which ones sink in water. Through hands-on experimentation with various household items and water play, they'll observe cause-and-effect relationships and begin to understand the science behind why some things float while others sink. This foundational science experience builds observation skills and introduces basic concepts about how different materials interact with water.

## Vocabulary

**Density**: The amount of mass packed into a given volume — how much "stuff" is crammed into a space. Water has a density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter (1 g/cm³). Objects denser than 1 g/cm³ sink; objects less dense than 1 g/cm³ float. A piece of wood is less dense than water (about 0.5-0.9 g/cm³) — that's why it floats. A rock is denser (about 2.5 g/cm³) — that's why it sinks. Density is mass ÷ volume.

**Buoyancy**: The upward force that water pushes on any object placed in it. Water pushes *up* on every object — the question is whether that upward push (the buoyant force) is strong enough to support the object's weight. If yes, the object floats. If no, it sinks.

**Archimedes' principle**: The rule discovered by the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes: when an object is placed in water, it displaces (pushes aside) a volume of water equal to the volume of the object submerged. The buoyant force equals the weight of water displaced. This is why a hollow boat floats — even though the metal is dense, the boat's shape captures air and makes its *average* density (metal + air) less than water.

**Submerge**: To push something completely below the surface of water. When you submerge an object, it displaces water — you can see the water level rise.

**Surface tension**: A thin, elastic-like "skin" on the surface of water, created by water molecules pulling on each other. Very light objects (a needle, a water strider insect) can rest on this surface without sinking, even though they're denser than water.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Wheels on the Bus

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
The buoyant cork goes up, up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up
The buoyant cork goes up, up, up
Floating on the water

The heavy rock goes down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
The heavy rock goes down, down, down
Sinking in the water

*Verse 2*
We observe what floats and sinks
Floats and sinks, floats and sinks
We observe what floats and sinks
Testing in the water

The density makes things sink
Things sink, things sink
The density makes things sink
Submerging in the water

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point upward with both hands when singing about floating and buoyant objects
2. Point downward when singing about sinking and submerging
3. Put hand to eyes like binoculars when singing "observe"

## Archimedes and the "Eureka!" Moment

About 2,250 years ago, a Greek mathematician named Archimedes was given a puzzle by the king: Was the king's crown made of pure gold, or had the goldsmith secretly mixed in cheaper silver? Archimedes needed to figure out the crown's density without melting it down.

One day, he stepped into his bath and noticed the water level rise. He realized: the volume of water displaced equals the volume of the object submerged. By measuring how much water the crown displaced, he could calculate its volume — and then divide its weight by its volume to get its density. If the density matched pure gold (19.3 g/cm³), it was real. If it was lower, silver had been mixed in.

The story says Archimedes was so excited he jumped out of his bath and ran through the streets shouting "**Eureka!**" — Greek for "I found it!" It's one of the most famous moments in the history of science.

**The shape trick — the most important lesson:**

Here's the crucial thing most people get wrong: **floating is about density, not weight.** A massive steel cruise ship weighs hundreds of thousands of tonnes but floats — because its hollow shape means its *average* density (steel walls + all the air inside) is less than water. A tiny steel ball bearing sinks — because it's solid steel with no air, so its density is much higher than water.

You can prove this at home: crumple a piece of aluminum foil into a ball — it sinks. But flatten the same piece into a bowl shape — it floats! Same material, same weight, but different shape (and therefore different average density).

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children fill a container with water and systematically test a variety of safe household items to discover which ones float and which ones sink. They'll make predictions before each test ("Will this float?"), then observe what actually happens, building critical thinking and observation skills. This simple experiment introduces scientific method concepts in an age-appropriate way.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration with discovery learning

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Large container (bathtub, water table, or deep bin filled with water)
- Lightweight floating objects (cork, sponge, plastic toy, wooden spoon, foam ball)
- Heavy sinking objects (rock, metal spoon, washcloth, toy car, plastic cup with water)
- Towels for cleanup and drying hands
- Washcloth or small sponge for wiping

**Optional**:
- Items sorted in two baskets before activity (floating vs. sinking items)
- Waterproof paper and markers to record observations with pictures
- Plastic apron to keep child dry
- Small net or slotted spoon for retrieving items

**Cost**: Free (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Fill your container with about 4-6 inches of water (warm enough to be comfortable but not hot)
2. Gather all test items and place them on a towel within child's reach
3. Place a large towel under and around the water container to catch splashes
4. Ensure all items are safe for water play (no small choking hazards, no sharp edges)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   - Sit with your child near the water container
   - Show them a floating object (cork or sponge) and say: "Watch what happens when we put this in the water!"
   - Gently place it in the water and let them observe it float
   - Use the vocabulary: "It's floating! It's buoyant! It stays on top of the water."
   - Do the same with a sinking object and say: "This one goes down... it sinks!"

2. **Exploration** (10-12 min):
   - Give your child one item at a time and ask: "Do you think this will float or sink?"
   - Allow them to make a prediction (even if just by guessing or shrugging)
   - Let them gently place the item in the water and watch what happens
   - Narrate what you see: "Look! The sponge is floating on top!" or "The rock is sinking all the way down!"
   - Continue with 6-8 different items, giving plenty of time for exploration
   - If your child wants to play and splash, that's okay—learning through play is valuable
   - Let them retrieve items with their hands or a net, building fine motor skills

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   - After testing several items, gather all the floating objects together: "Look at all the things that float!"
   - Then gather the sinking objects: "And look at these—they all went down!"
   - Ask observational questions: "Which ones stayed on top?" "Which ones went to the bottom?" "What do you notice?"
   - Explain the real reason: "Things float or sink based on their density — how much stuff is packed inside them compared to water. Wood is less packed than water, so it floats. Rock is more packed, so it sinks." (Avoid saying "light things float" — a cruise ship is very heavy and it floats!)
   - **Do the foil experiment**: Crumple a small piece of foil into a ball and drop it — it sinks. Then unfold it into a bowl shape and float it. "Same foil, same weight — but when it traps air, it floats! That's why boats float even though they're made of metal."
   - If your child is ready: "Archimedes discovered this rule in his bathtub 2,000 years ago. He was so excited he shouted Eureka — that means 'I found it!'"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   - Help your child remove items from water and place them on towels to dry
   - Let them splash hands in the water a few more times if interested
   - Transition by saying: "We discovered which things float and which things sink! Scientists do experiments just like this."
   - Dry hands and start cleanup together

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use only 3-4 familiar objects (toy, sponge, block, spoon)
- Focus on the sensory experience of water play rather than the science concept
- Don't worry about predictions—just observe what happens
- Keep activity shorter (10 minutes) with frequent breaks
- Emphasize vocabulary repetition: "Floating... floating... sinking... sinking..."
- Allow lots of splashing and water play to build comfort with water

**3-4+ years**:
- Use 8-10 different items for more comparison
- Ask predictions before each test and then discuss why the result happened
- Explicitly introduce density: "The rock is denser than water — it has more stuff packed in, so water can't hold it up."
- Do the foil ball-vs-bowl experiment and explain average density and trapped air
- Ask: "Why does a boat float even though it's made of heavy metal?" (Hollow shape + air = average density less than water)
- Introduce "buoyancy" and "Archimedes' principle" with the Eureka story
- Record observations with drawings or a "float" / "sink" T-chart

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - The Prediction Game**: Before testing each new item, have your child make a prediction and place it in a "I think it will float" or "I think it will sink" basket. Then test it together and move it to the correct basket afterward.

**Variation 2 - Sink or Float Search**: Give your child a nature walk around the house or yard to find objects to test. They collect items (safe ones) and predict before dunking them in water.

**Repeat Play - Water Table Routine**: Keep a water table or large container set up for repeated play. Leave the materials available and let your child continue experimenting independently during free play time. Add new items each week to keep it interesting.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child pours water out of the container or over themselves instead of testing objects.
**Solution**: This is normal exploratory behavior for toddlers. Expect some water play and spillage. Use a large, sturdy container that won't tip easily. Have extra towels ready. If you need to redirect, acknowledge their interest ("You love making splashes!") while gently guiding them back to the float/sink activity. Consider this a water exploration session rather than a focused science lesson.

**Challenge**: Child wants to put non-water-safe items (like books, electronics, or toys with batteries) in the water.
**Solution**: Pre-screen all materials before the activity and only present water-safe items. If your child wants to test something else, calmly say "That's not for water" and offer a water-safe alternative instead. Keep the activity supervised and establish clear boundaries about what goes in water.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest after 5 minutes or gets frustrated when something unexpected happens (like a toy they thought would float actually sinks).
**Solution**: Keep the activity shorter and more playful with younger children—5-10 minutes is plenty. Don't force learning; if they want to stop, stop. Every child's developmental readiness is different. Reframe unexpected outcomes positively: "Wow, that block sank! That's what happens—blocks are heavy!"

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Floating Toys Bath Time**: During regular bath time, provide bath toys and ask the floating/sinking questions informally. Build vocabulary through natural play opportunities.

2. **Sink or Float Story**: Read a picture book about water, boats, or swimming. Point out floating and sinking references: "Look, the duck is floating in the pond!"

3. **Real-World Connection**: During water-related activities (washing dishes, watering plants, filling a pool), occasionally ask: "Will the sponge sink or float?" and "Why does the soap bubble float?"
