# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Skill Demonstration and Modeling

## Activity Summary

Skill demonstration and modeling is when an adult or older child intentionally shows how to do something step-by-step while children watch and learn. Children develop skills through observational learning by watching someone perform a task clearly and then practicing what they've seen. This activity builds vocabulary, shows problem-solving processes, and helps children understand what's possible before they try it themselves.

## Vocabulary

**Demonstrate**: To show someone how to do something by doing it slowly and carefully so they can watch and learn. When you demonstrate tying shoes, you move slowly and explain each step.

**Observe**: To watch something carefully and notice what is happening. When you observe a skill being demonstrated, you pay close attention to the steps and movements.

**Sequential**: Happening in a particular order, one step after another. Tying shoes is sequential because you must do certain steps in the correct order to make it work.

**Model**: An example that shows the right way to do something; or to demonstrate and show how something is done. When you model good behavior, you show others the way to do it correctly.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: London Bridge Is Falling Down

**Tempo**: Moderate

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*
Watch me show you how to do,
How to do, how to do,
Watch me show you how to do,
Step by step now.

*Verse 2*
Now you try to do it too,
Do it too, do it too,
Now you try to do it too,
You can do it!

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point to eyes and nod - show you are watching and observing carefully
2. Copy a simple motion with your hands - demonstrate imitating what you see
3. Clap hands together - celebrate trying and practicing

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will watch you demonstrate a specific skill (such as tying shoes, painting with proper brush technique, building with blocks, or washing hands) while you narrate each step clearly and slowly. After observation, children will practice the skill with your support. This builds their understanding of what's possible and gives them a mental model to copy.

**Activity Type**: Observational learning and skill-building

**Duration**: 5-15 minutes for observation; followed by practice time if desired

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Materials needed for the specific skill being demonstrated (e.g., shoe with laces, paintbrush and paint, blocks, scissors and paper)
- Clear, uncluttered demonstration space

**Optional**:
- Duplicate materials so children can practice while watching
- Picture sequence chart showing the steps
- Video recording device to replay demonstrations
- Pointer or markers to highlight key steps

**Cost**: Free (using materials already available)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Choose a specific skill to demonstrate that children are interested in and ready to learn
2. Practice the demonstration so you can narrate the steps clearly and confidently
3. Identify the 2-4 core steps to focus on (not every detail, just the main process)
4. Gather all materials and arrange seating so all children have a clear view
5. Remove distractions from the environment

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (1-2 minutes):
   Build anticipation by showing the materials and focusing attention: "I'm going to show you how to tie shoes. Watch carefully and see if you can remember the steps." Ask a question to focus their observation: "What do you think happens first?"

2. **Full Demonstration** (2-4 minutes):
   Demonstrate the complete skill once while narrating slowly and clearly. Speak deliberately, pause between steps, and point to key parts. Use consistent language: "First, I take one end. Now I cross it over. Now I pull tight." Keep your hands positioned so children see everything clearly.

3. **Repeat and Highlight** (2-4 minutes):
   Do the demonstration again, this time adding more detail or asking questions: "See how I'm checking this part? Why do you think I do that?" Invite children to narrate along if they remember the steps. Focus on the trickiest parts by demonstrating them slowly and carefully.

4. **Key Points and Understanding** (1-2 minutes):
   Show a common mistake and the correct way: "If I do it this way, it doesn't work. But when I do it this way, it works!" Ask children what they noticed: "What was different those two times?" Check understanding by asking: "What was the first step?"

5. **Wrap-up** (1-2 minutes):
   Celebrate the skill and normalize that children won't be perfect yet. Offer practice if appropriate: "Would you like to try it now?" If practicing, provide support as children work through the steps with your guidance.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep demonstrations very short with 2-4 highly visible steps. Use large, exaggerated movements and simple narration: "I pull. I cross. I pull. It's tight!" Repeat many times since toddlers need repetition. Have children practice while you demonstrate simultaneously. Keep demonstrations to 3-5 minutes and celebrate any imitation, even if not accurate. Provide hands-on support during practice.

**3-4+ years**:
Demonstrate more complex skills with 4-5 or more steps. Show problem-solving approaches: "First I check if it's tight. If it's not, I tighten it more." Introduce variations and ask children to predict: "What do you think happens next?" before showing. Have children verbally describe what they see. Show the skill both slowly and at normal speed. Extend demonstrations to 5-15 minutes. Eventually have children demonstrate for others.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Slow-Motion Breakdown - Choose one tricky step and break it into smaller pieces. Demonstrate just that step several times to build mastery.

**Variation 2**: Comparison Demonstrations - Show multiple ways to accomplish the same goal. "Here's one way to build a tower. Here's another way. Both work!"

**Variation 3**: Mistake and Fix - Intentionally demonstrate a common mistake, then show the correct way. Children learn what to watch for.

**Variation 4**: Child as Demonstrator - Once a child has learned through observation and practice, let them demonstrate for others. This builds confidence and reinforces learning.

**Repeat play**: Demonstrate the same skill over multiple days or weeks. Each repetition with a different focus keeps children engaged. Use each showing to highlight different aspects: "This time, watch my hands. Now watch where I'm looking."

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Children don't watch or are distracted during the demonstration

**Solution**: Keep demonstrations very short (under 5 minutes for younger children). Do it when children are rested and content, not hungry or tired. Remove competing distractions from the environment. Make the demonstration exciting using your voice and emphasizing key moments. Consider doing it during a time when children are already sitting rather than asking them to sit first.

**Challenge**: Children copy the demonstration but don't seem to truly understand it

**Solution**: This is developmentally normal. Young children learn through imitation first; understanding develops through repeated practice. Celebrate the copying as a learning step: "You're doing it just like I showed you!" Keep repeating the demonstration over time. Ask questions to build understanding slowly: "What comes next?" or "Why do you think I held it that way?"

**Challenge**: Children want to see the demonstration repeatedly

**Solution**: This is perfect! Repetition is how young children learn. They need to see skills many times before fully understanding them. Repeat the demonstration as often as children request. Use each repetition to highlight different aspects: "This time, watch my hands. Now watch where I'm looking."

**Challenge**: Children want to practice immediately rather than just watch

**Solution**: This is fine! Combine observation with immediate practice. Demonstrate once or twice, then let children practice while you guide them. Some children learn better by practicing alongside the demonstration rather than just watching first.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Repeated Practice**: Demonstrate the skill again over several days, focusing on different aspects each time to deepen understanding
2. **Guided Practice**: Support children in practicing the skill after observation, using the same language you used in the demonstration
3. **Real-World Application**: Point out when children see the skill being used in everyday life: "Remember how we showed you how to tie shoes? Look, that big kid is tying their shoes too!"
