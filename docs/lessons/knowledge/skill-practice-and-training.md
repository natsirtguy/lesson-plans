# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Skill Practice and Training

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces children to the concept that skills develop through repeated practice and persistence. Through playful, focused activities, children practice fundamental motor and coordination skills while learning that effort and repetition help them improve over time, building confidence and a growth mindset.

## Vocabulary

**Practice**: Doing something many times so you get better and better at it. When you throw a ball over and over, you're practicing your throwing skill.

**Persistence**: Keeping trying even when something is hard or you don't get it right the first time. When you keep attempting to climb a structure even after you slip, you're showing persistence.

**Progress**: Getting better and stronger at something because you've been working on it. When you can catch a ball after many tries, that's progress.

**Skill**: Something you can do well because you've learned it and practiced it many times. Climbing, throwing, drawing, and buttoning are all skills.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Wheels on the Bus

**Tempo**: Upbeat and encouraging

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
When I practice every day, every day, every day
When I practice every day, I build my skill

I show persistence when it's hard, when it's hard, when it's hard
I show persistence when it's hard, I don't give up

*Verse 2*
I can see my progress grow, progress grow, progress grow
I can see my progress grow, getting better

My new skill gets strong and bright, strong and bright, strong and bright
My new skill gets strong and bright, with practice time

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Make repeated practice motions like throwing or catching
2. Flex both arms to show getting stronger through persistence
3. Clap hands together when singing about progress and skill

## Intro Video Recommendation

**Recommended video**: Search for "Growth Mindset for Preschoolers" or "Learning Through Practice for Toddlers"

**What to look for**:
- 3-5 minutes long
- Shows children practicing skills (throwing, climbing, drawing)
- Emphasizes effort and trying again after mistakes
- Positive, encouraging tone
- Simple language ("keep trying," "you're getting better")

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will practice a specific gross motor skill (throwing and catching) in a structured but playful way. Through multiple successful attempts and gentle encouragement, they'll experience how practice leads to improvement, building confidence and understanding that skills develop through repetition.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on skill practice with repetition and celebration

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Soft ball (foam, soft fabric, or bean bag)
- Open floor space (minimum 6x6 feet)
- Optional target (bucket, hula hoop, or taped square on ground)

**Optional**:
- Cones or tape to mark boundaries
- Prize basket (stickers, small toys)
- Progress chart for tracking

**Cost**: Free to under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Clear a safe open space with soft flooring (carpet, grass, or mat)
2. Set up a simple target about 4-6 feet away (bucket, hula hoop, or taped square)
3. Place the soft ball in the center
4. Have a place to sit nearby to observe and encourage

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   - Sit with your child and explain: "Today we're going to practice throwing! When we practice, we do something many times so we get better and better at it."
   - Demonstrate a gentle throw toward the target
   - Say: "When you practice, your arm gets stronger and you get better at hitting the target. Let's try!"
   - Sing a quick verse of the learning song while demonstrating

2. **Exploration** (8-12 minutes):
   - Invite your child to pick up the soft ball
   - Encourage them to throw it toward the target
   - Whether they hit the target or not, celebrate the attempt: "You tried! That's great! You're practicing!"
   - Retrieve the ball and invite them to try again
   - Continue for 10-15 throws, celebrating each attempt
   - Optional: Count the successful hits on fingers: "That's one! Now two! Look at your progress!"
   - Keep the atmosphere playful and non-competitive

3. **Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   - Ask simple questions:
     - "Did your throw feel different than before? Getting better?"
     - "How many times did we throw the ball?"
     - "Do you think we could throw 10 times? Let's count!"
   - Point out progress: "Your throws are getting stronger! You're really practicing well!"
   - Let them initiate additional rounds if engaged

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   - Celebrate with enthusiasm: "You practiced so hard today! You threw the ball many times and you got better and better!"
   - Give a special "Practice Award" (sticker, high-five, special praise)
   - Transition with a song or simple movement activity

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use larger, lighter targets (5-gallon bucket, large hula hoop)
- Stand closer to the target (2-3 feet away)
- Focus on the act of throwing rather than accuracy
- Keep sessions shorter (8-10 minutes)
- Provide immediate, enthusiastic celebration for every attempt
- Use simpler language: "Throw! Try again! Good trying!"

**3-4+ years**:
- Gradually increase distance to target (4-6 feet)
- Challenge them to throw different ways (underhand, overhand, sitting)
- Keep score of successful hits and track progress over sessions
- Ask them to reflect on their improvement: "Did you do better than yesterday?"
- Introduce more complex challenges (throwing while standing on one foot, throwing with non-dominant hand)
- Encourage them to set personal goals: "Can you make 5 hits today?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Different Skills**: Practice other skills like catching (rolling a soft ball for them to catch), climbing (low structures), or drawing (lines and shapes). The key is repetition with the same skill until improvement is visible.

**Variation 2: Obstacle Course**: Create a simple obstacle course (crawling under a blanket, stepping over cushions, balancing on a line) and practice it repeatedly. Children can see themselves getting faster and more confident.

**Repeat Play**: Same activity works beautifully for repeat sessions. Children enjoy practicing the same skill daily and feel genuine joy when they see their improvement. Mark successes on a chart to make progress visible.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated after a few unsuccessful attempts

**Solution**: Reframe misses as learning opportunities. "You're practicing! Every throw helps your arm learn." Celebrate the effort, not just success. Lower the target distance temporarily so they experience quick wins, then gradually increase difficulty.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest or seems bored with repetition

**Solution**: Toddlers actually love repetition, but novelty helps maintain engagement. Change the target location, try a different ball, or practice a different skill entirely. Sing the song during practice to add structure and fun.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't see progress and gets discouraged

**Solution**: Make progress visible. Keep a simple chart with stickers for each session. Point out small improvements: "You threw that further than last time!" or "You tried 10 times today and you made 3 hits—that's great!" Take photos or videos to show growth over a week.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Practice Sessions**: Choose one skill and practice it for 5-10 minutes each day for a week. Children thrive with consistency and will show marked improvement within days.

2. **Skill Variety**: Once your child masters throwing/catching, rotate to other skills (climbing, drawing shapes, balancing, pedaling a tricycle). The concept of "practice = improvement" transfers across all skills.

3. **Real-World Connection**: Point out people practicing skills in daily life: "Look, the gardener is raking leaves—they're practicing! That's how they learned to rake so well."
