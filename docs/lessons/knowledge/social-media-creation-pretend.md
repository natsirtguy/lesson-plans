# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Social Media Creation (Pretend)

## 🎯 Activity Summary

In this imaginative activity, children explore the concept of sharing and creating content through pretend play, simulating social media experiences in an age-appropriate, screen-free way. Children use art materials, props, and storytelling to create "posts," take pretend photos, and share their creations with others, developing communication skills, creative expression, and an understanding of how people share experiences.

## Vocabulary

**Platform**: A digital place — a website or app — where people can share content with others. Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok are platforms. Each has different rules for what you share (photos, videos, short clips).

**Content**: What you create and share — photos, videos, drawings, or writing. Creators think carefully about what their content communicates and who will see it.

**Audience**: The people who see your content. A good creator thinks about their audience: Who are they? What will they find interesting, funny, or useful? Thinking about your audience shapes what you choose to create.

**Composition**: How you arrange elements within a frame. Photographers use rules like "rule of thirds" — imagining the frame divided into a 3×3 grid and placing important things along those lines rather than dead center. This makes photos feel more interesting.

**Caption**: Words added to a photo or image that explain, describe, or add meaning. A great caption can completely change how a viewer understands an image.

**Curation**: Thoughtfully selecting what to include and what to leave out. Social media feeds are curated — people choose their best moments and most appealing images. This is why feeds often don't show the full picture of real life.

**Narrative**: A story told through images and words in sequence. Many creators tell stories across multiple posts, building suspense or showing a process from start to finish.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: London Bridge Is Falling Down

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 4-6 lines each):

*Verse 1*
We can make a picture bright
Paint and draw with all our might
Share our art with friends today
Show them in a special way

*Verse 2*
Colors dance across the page
Every artist finds their stage
Display it for the world to see
Show your own creativity

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Make sweeping painting motions with both arms while singing "paint and draw"
2. Hold hands up and spread fingers wide when singing "share our art" (like opening a gallery)
3. Clap gently on beat while singing about showing or displaying

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children learn what social media actually is — platforms where people create and share content with audiences — then practice the real skills involved: thinking about composition, considering their audience, adding captions, and curating what to share. The activity introduces basic photography and media literacy concepts while remaining screen-free and hands-on.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression / Pretend play / Social activity

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper (standard, cardstock, or construction paper) - 5-10 sheets per child
- Markers, crayons, or colored pencils - variety of colors
- Child-safe scissors - 1-2 pairs
- Glue stick or tape
- Toy camera, smartphone (turned off), tablet (turned off), or cardboard camera made from a box

**Optional**:
- Stickers, washi tape, or decorative elements
- Magazines for cutting pictures
- Props (hats, scarves, toys)
- Whiteboard or paper for captions and comments
- Picture frames (cardboard or plastic)
- Printed templates of "post" shapes (hearts, stars, rectangles)
- Gold stars or "like" stickers

**Cost**: Free (using paper, markers, and household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all materials and place in accessible containers
2. Set up a "creation station" with table space and a "gallery wall" or display table for finished posts
3. Prepare the toy/pretend camera and any props
4. Cover table with paper or washable tablecloth to protect surface

**Activity Flow**:

1. **What is social media?** (3-4 min):
   Explain: "Social media is a platform — a digital place — where people create content and share it with an audience. Some platforms are for photos, some for videos, some for short thoughts. Millions of people around the world share what they're doing, making, or thinking." Show the toy camera: "Today we're going to be content creators — people who make things to share. Real content creators think carefully before they post: Who is my audience? What story am I telling? What's the best way to show it?"

2. **Photography basics** (3-4 min):
   Demonstrate composition with the toy camera or a paper frame: "Professional photographers use a rule called 'rule of thirds.' Instead of putting your subject right in the center, you put it a little off to the side." Hold up a frame and show how placing a stuffed animal at the edge looks more interesting than dead center. Talk about lighting: "Good photographers look for light — a window, sunlight — because it makes the subject easier to see." Let children practice "framing" objects around the room with their hands or the toy camera.

3. **Creation** (8-12 min):
   Children create their "post." Before starting, ask: "Who is your audience? What do you want them to feel when they see this?" Encourage thinking about composition as they arrange materials: "Where is your main subject? Is it off to the side a little?" Help add a caption — what words explain or add meaning to the image? Even a dictated one-line caption works perfectly.

4. **Gallery and media literacy** (4-5 min):
   Display all posts on the gallery wall. Walk through the "feed" together. Then introduce media literacy: "On real social media, people only share their best moments — the ones they're proud of. They don't post pictures when they're sad or the day was boring. So when you see someone's feed, you're seeing their curated highlights, not their whole life." Ask: "Do you think that's confusing for people who forget that?"

5. **Wrap-up** (2 min):
   "You were content creators today — you thought about composition, your audience, and your caption. Real creators do exactly this, every time they post."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Focus on the photography framing activity and simple creation. Use the words "platform," "audience," and "caption" naturally without requiring full comprehension. The key concept to land: people make things to share with others, and they think about how it looks. Keep the media literacy discussion brief: "People share their favorite moments." Celebrate scribbles as legitimate posts — the creative decision is the point, not the product quality.

**3-4+ years**:
Go deeper on the rule of thirds — draw the grid on paper and practice placing subjects. Discuss what makes a photo interesting vs. boring (lighting, angle, subject choice). Ask about multiple post formats: "Some people post videos. Some post a series of three photos. What format would you use?" Extend the media literacy discussion: "If someone only posts smiling pictures, is that the whole truth about their life?" Introduce the idea of an algorithm — "platforms use computers to show people the posts the computer thinks they'll like most, based on what they clicked before."

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Photo Props Studio**
Set up a pretend photo studio where children dress up with props, pose for the toy camera, and then draw or paint what they "looked like" in their photo. Connects real self-images with artistic representation.

**Variation 2: Story Series Posts**
Create a series of connected "posts" that tell a story across multiple drawings: "First my character woke up, then... then... then." This introduces sequencing and narrative development.

**Variation 3: Collaborative Feed**
Create one large "wall" or "feed" where multiple children contribute to the same display, building a shared gallery. Older children can arrange posts, create titles, or add frames.

**Thematic variations**:
- Seasonal posts: "What do you see in spring/winter?"
- Holiday creations: "Create a post about your favorite holiday memory"
- Interest-based: "Make a post about animals," "Show us your favorite food"
- Emotion posts: "Make a post that shows how you feel today"
- Adventure series: Children create a sequence showing an imaginary adventure

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is hesitant or anxious about sharing their work
**Solution**: Normalize all attempts—"There's no right or wrong way to make art. Your picture is special because you made it." Don't force sharing; let them decide. Start with small group shares or one-on-one if needed. Ask what they'd like others to know about their work.

**Challenge**: One child dominates materials or wants to create continuously while others are ready to move on
**Solution**: Set clear time parameters before starting: "We're going to create for 20 minutes, then we'll share." Use a visual timer. Offer choices at transition: "You can finish this one more post or help with the gallery." Ensure enough materials for everyone to work.

**Challenge**: Child compares their work negatively to others' creations
**Solution**: Emphasize different, not better—"Everyone chose different colors and shapes. That's what makes each post special." Highlight specific strengths in each child's work: "You used so many colors!" "Your shapes are interesting."

**Challenge**: Mess escalates with multiple children, materials get scattered
**Solution**: Contain materials in bins or boxes. Use individual trays or table sections for each child. Set clear expectations: "Markers stay on the table." Have cleanup supplies accessible.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Create a portfolio**: Keep creations in a folder or box throughout the month to see growth over time
2. **Make a book**: Compile multiple "posts" into a bound book titled "Our Gallery" or "Our Posts"
3. **Share with family**: Take photos of displays and send them home, or send the original artwork with a note about what the child shared
