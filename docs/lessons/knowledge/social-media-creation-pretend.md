# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Social Media Creation (Pretend)

## 🎯 Activity Summary

In this imaginative activity, children explore the concept of sharing and creating content through pretend play, simulating social media experiences in an age-appropriate, screen-free way. Children use art materials, props, and storytelling to create "posts," take pretend photos, and share their creations with others, developing communication skills, creative expression, and an understanding of how people share experiences.

## Vocabulary

**Composition**: The way different elements (colors, shapes, objects) are arranged together in a picture or artwork. When you decide where to place your drawings on the paper, you're creating a composition—just like how a photographer positions things in a photo.

**Narrative**: A story that unfolds through pictures or words, showing a sequence of events or ideas. A narrative "post" might show what you did first, then second, then third—like chapters in a picture story.

**Self-expression**: The act of showing your own feelings, thoughts, and ideas through creative work like drawing, painting, or building. Self-expression is when your art tells the world something about what makes you unique.

**Curation**: Thoughtfully selecting and arranging items to display them in a way that shows care and intention. When you choose which pictures to put in your gallery or how to arrange them on a wall, you're curating a display.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: London Bridge Is Falling Down

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 4-6 lines each):

*Verse 1*
We can make a picture bright
Paint and draw with all our might
Share our art with friends today
Show them in a special way

*Verse 2*
Colors dance across the page
Every artist finds their stage
Display it for the world to see
Show your own creativity

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Make sweeping painting motions with both arms while singing "paint and draw"
2. Hold hands up and spread fingers wide when singing "share our art" (like opening a gallery)
3. Clap gently on beat while singing about showing or displaying

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children explore materials and create original "posts" using art supplies, then share their creations with peers in a gallery-style display. Through this pretend social media experience, children develop fine motor skills, creative confidence, and understanding that sharing one's work brings joy to both creator and audience.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression / Pretend play / Social activity

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper (standard, cardstock, or construction paper) - 5-10 sheets per child
- Markers, crayons, or colored pencils - variety of colors
- Child-safe scissors - 1-2 pairs
- Glue stick or tape
- Toy camera, smartphone (turned off), tablet (turned off), or cardboard camera made from a box

**Optional**:
- Stickers, washi tape, or decorative elements
- Magazines for cutting pictures
- Props (hats, scarves, toys)
- Whiteboard or paper for captions and comments
- Picture frames (cardboard or plastic)
- Printed templates of "post" shapes (hearts, stars, rectangles)
- Gold stars or "like" stickers

**Cost**: Free (using paper, markers, and household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all materials and place in accessible containers
2. Set up a "creation station" with table space and a "gallery wall" or display table for finished posts
3. Prepare the toy/pretend camera and any props
4. Cover table with paper or washable tablecloth to protect surface

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Ask children: "Do you know what it means when grown-ups share pictures with their friends?" Show the toy camera and say: "Today, we're going to be artists and photographers! We're going to create special pictures and share them, just like people do on their phones." Demonstrate by creating a quick drawing and explaining why you made it.

2. **Exploration** (5-10 min):
   Invite children to browse materials and think about what they want to create. Ask guiding questions: "What makes you happy? What's your favorite thing? What do you want to show your friends?" Allow free exploration and scribbling. Children may start creating immediately or need time to think.

3. **Creation** (8-15 min):
   Show how to arrange materials on paper as if it's a phone screen. Demonstrate simple techniques like drawing, pasting stickers, and using markers. Ask questions about their work: "What colors will you use? What's happening in your picture? Tell me about what you made." Offer support with fine motor skills. Allow children to create multiple "posts" if interested. For older children, discuss adding simple words or captions.

4. **Wrap-up** (3-5 min):
   Gather in a sharing circle. Invite each child to show their creation and tell about it: "Tell us what you made. Why did you like making this?" Display all creations on the gallery wall. Celebrate: "Everyone made something special! These are beautiful posts from amazing artists." Help children put materials away together.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus on the process of making marks and choosing colors rather than creating a story
- Keep materials simpler: crayons and paper primarily, maybe stickers
- Show more, say less; use simple language
- Adult provides hands-on support with fine motor skills
- Celebrate simple scribbles and marks as valid "posts"
- Shorter duration: 15-20 minutes

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce narrative elements: "Your post can tell a story"
- Offer writing/labeling: Help add simple words or captions
- More complex creative choices: combining materials, making designs, arranging elements thoughtfully
- Introduce pretend "comments": Others say what they like about the post
- Optional: Create a pretend "like" system using stickers or hearts
- May engage for 30+ minutes and want to create multiple posts

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Photo Props Studio**
Set up a pretend photo studio where children dress up with props, pose for the toy camera, and then draw or paint what they "looked like" in their photo. Connects real self-images with artistic representation.

**Variation 2: Story Series Posts**
Create a series of connected "posts" that tell a story across multiple drawings: "First my character woke up, then... then... then." This introduces sequencing and narrative development.

**Variation 3: Collaborative Feed**
Create one large "wall" or "feed" where multiple children contribute to the same display, building a shared gallery. Older children can arrange posts, create titles, or add frames.

**Thematic variations**:
- Seasonal posts: "What do you see in spring/winter?"
- Holiday creations: "Create a post about your favorite holiday memory"
- Interest-based: "Make a post about animals," "Show us your favorite food"
- Emotion posts: "Make a post that shows how you feel today"
- Adventure series: Children create a sequence showing an imaginary adventure

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is hesitant or anxious about sharing their work
**Solution**: Normalize all attempts—"There's no right or wrong way to make art. Your picture is special because you made it." Don't force sharing; let them decide. Start with small group shares or one-on-one if needed. Ask what they'd like others to know about their work.

**Challenge**: One child dominates materials or wants to create continuously while others are ready to move on
**Solution**: Set clear time parameters before starting: "We're going to create for 20 minutes, then we'll share." Use a visual timer. Offer choices at transition: "You can finish this one more post or help with the gallery." Ensure enough materials for everyone to work.

**Challenge**: Child compares their work negatively to others' creations
**Solution**: Emphasize different, not better—"Everyone chose different colors and shapes. That's what makes each post special." Highlight specific strengths in each child's work: "You used so many colors!" "Your shapes are interesting."

**Challenge**: Mess escalates with multiple children, materials get scattered
**Solution**: Contain materials in bins or boxes. Use individual trays or table sections for each child. Set clear expectations: "Markers stay on the table." Have cleanup supplies accessible.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Create a portfolio**: Keep creations in a folder or box throughout the month to see growth over time
2. **Make a book**: Compile multiple "posts" into a bound book titled "Our Gallery" or "Our Posts"
3. **Share with family**: Take photos of displays and send them home, or send the original artwork with a note about what the child shared
