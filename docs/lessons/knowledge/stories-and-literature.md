# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Stories and Literature

## Activity Summary

Children will explore the magic of storytelling and books through interactive read-aloud experiences, dramatic storytelling, and book exploration activities. They'll discover how stories have characters, settings, and events that unfold in sequence, building foundational literacy skills and a love of reading.

## Vocabulary

**Character**: A person, animal, or creature in a story who does things and has feelings. When you read about Goldilocks trying the porridge in "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," Goldilocks is the character—the one doing the action.

**Setting**: The place and time where a story happens. In the story "Where the Wild Things Are," the setting includes Max's bedroom at the beginning and the island with wild things where he goes on his adventure.

**Narrative**: A story that has a beginning, middle, and end that tells about events or adventures that happen one after another. When we listen to "The Three Little Pigs," we're following a narrative that shows what happens first, next, and last.

**Illustrate**: To create pictures or drawings that show what's happening in a story and help us understand and visualize the characters and events. The colorful pictures in children's books illustrate the words and make the story come alive.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: The Itsy Bitsy Spider

**Tempo**: Gentle and engaging

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
The character climbed up the story page
With a setting and a brand new stage
And the narrative had a start, middle, end
So the character learned lessons as a friend

*Verse 2*
Adventures went down through every tale
With illustrations they could never fail
And the characters came back with lessons learned
As the narrator's voice returned

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Open hands like a book opening when singing about stories
2. Trace upward climbing motions during verse 1
3. Point to eyes then sweep arms wide to show pictures and illustrations
4. Make a turning page gesture during the transitions

## Intro Video Recommendation

**Recommended video**: Search YouTube for "StoryCorps Kids Stories" or "Puffin Rock" - These BBC children's shows feature gentle, engaging storytelling with beautiful illustrations and calming narration perfect for ages 2-4.

**What to look for**:
- 2-5 minutes long
- Slow, clear narration with natural pauses
- Bright, colorful illustrations that move as the story progresses
- Warm, encouraging tone
- Familiar animals or relatable characters
- No sudden loud noises or scary elements

**Alternative searches**:
- "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood read aloud" (familiar, friendly character)
- "Little Baby Bum story time for toddlers" (engaging with repetitive elements)
- "CoComelon Stories and Songs" (music-integrated storytelling)
- "Bluey official videos" (engaging, age-appropriate storytelling)

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will become active participants in storytelling by creating their own simple narrative with props, pictures, and actions. They'll retell a familiar story or create a new one using felt pieces, puppets, or pictures arranged in sequence, developing sequencing skills and understanding of story structure while building confidence as storytellers.

**Activity Type**: Dramatic play and narrative creation activity

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 10 minutes (gathering and arranging materials)

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards or felt pieces showing a simple 3-4 step story (can be hand-drawn or printed)
- A familiar short story you know well (The Three Little Pigs, Goldilocks, Little Red Hen, etc.)
- Stuffed animals or simple puppets (even socks with drawn faces work)
- A small container or bag to hold props

**Optional**:
- Colored felt pieces for creating scenes
- Simple costumes (hats, scarves, aprons)
- Picture book version of the story to reference
- Basket or "stage area" for storytelling
- Printable story sequencing cards

**Cost**: Free (using items you have at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Select a very familiar, short story with a clear beginning, middle, and end (3-4 main events)
2. Gather simple props or draw/print picture cards showing the main story events in order
3. Arrange props on a low table or blanket where the child can reach and manipulate them
4. Test that all pieces are safe (no small parts that could be choking hazards)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Say: "We're going to tell a story together using these pictures and toys! Do you know the story of [The Three Little Pigs]? Let me show you what happens." Show the first picture card or prop and name it: "Here's the first little pig!" Point to the beginning event and say what's happening in simple language. Build excitement: "When I turn this over, something happens next!"

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   Let the child handle the props and picture cards. Ask them to arrange them in order while you narrate, or ask them to help: "What happens first?" "What does the pig do next?" With puppets or stuffed animals, encourage them to make the characters "act out" the story. They can move the pig across the table, have it knock on a door, hide from the wolf, etc. Use exaggerated voices and movements: "Oh no! The wolf is coming!" Help them understand sequence by saying: "First the pig built... then the wolf came... next he ran to..."

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Ask guiding questions: "Where is the pig now?" "What's going to happen next?" "How do you think the pig feels?" "Why did the pig do that?" Point out story elements: "See how this is the setting—the forest—and this is the character—the little pig?" Celebrate their storytelling: "You told me what happened first, next, and last. That's a great story!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Ask if they want to tell the story again or tell a different version: "What if the pig was really brave? What would the pig do?" Help them retell it with variations. Praise their narrative skills: "You're such a good storyteller! You know what happens from the beginning to the end!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep the story to 2-3 main events maximum. Focus on concrete props they can manipulate (stuffed animals, blocks). Use very simple language and repeat key phrases: "The pig ran, ran, RAN!" Let them point to what happens next rather than verbally sequencing. Make animal sounds together and do actions (sniffing like a wolf, trotting like a pig). Don't worry if they don't follow the exact sequence—the goal is exploration and enjoyment of the activity.

**3-4+ years**:
Use stories with 4-5 events and more complex emotions. Encourage them to retell the entire story with your support: "Can you tell me what happened?" Ask them to predict: "What happens next? Why do you think so?" Introduce new vocabulary: "The wolf was frustrated because..." Challenge them to create variations: "What if the pig was silly instead of scared?" Have them use multiple props to create different scenes and settings.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Puppet Show Creation**: Make simple paper puppets from popsicle sticks and paper cups. Decorate them together, then perform a story behind a blanket draped over chairs. Record their storytelling on your phone for them to watch and enjoy again.

**Variation 2 - Story Stone Version**: Draw or paste pictures on stones/painted rocks showing story events. Have the child arrange the stones to retell the story, or roll them to create random new stories using the same characters.

**Repeat play**: Change the story each week with a new familiar book. Create new props for different tales. Let them teach the story to other family members, siblings, or dolls. Draw their own story pictures and tell stories about them.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't retell the story or goes off on tangents with unrelated narratives.
**Solution**: This is completely developmentally normal, especially for 2-3 year olds. Join them in their creative direction rather than correcting. If they say "The pig flies to the moon," respond: "Oh! The pig is flying to the moon! What happens when he gets there?" This validates their creativity and keeps them engaged. Gradually introduce the concept of following the main story events.

**Challenge**: Child becomes distracted or loses interest partway through the activity.
**Solution**: Stories are long for toddlers—2-3 minutes of focused storytelling is actually excellent. Stop before they lose interest and transition to free play with the props. Return to structured storytelling tomorrow. You can also break it into multiple sessions: one day they arrange the pictures, another day they act it out with puppets.

**Challenge**: Child wants to listen to the story but won't participate in retelling it.
**Solution**: Listening is a valuable part of literacy development. Let them watch and listen without pressure to perform. Ask easy questions that require only pointing: "Point to the pig." Celebrate their listening: "You heard the whole story!" As confidence grows, they may participate more naturally.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily life connections**: Point out story elements in everyday moments. "Look, that's like when [character] did [action]!" Help them see narratives everywhere: "First you put on your shoes, next we go outside, then we play—that's a story!"

2. **Create a story together**: Ask leading questions to build a simple narrative together: "Should we tell a story about a bear? What does the bear see first? Then what?" Write or draw their story and read it back to them.

3. **Visit the library**: Build a collection of favorite picture books. Return often to reread familiar stories—repetition builds familiarity, confidence, and vocabulary. Let them choose books to bring home.
