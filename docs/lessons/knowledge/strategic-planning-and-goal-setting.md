# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Strategic Planning and Goal Setting

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Through creative goal-setting activities, children learn to think about what they want to accomplish, plan simple steps to get there, and celebrate their achievements. This activity builds executive function, self-awareness, and confidence by helping young children express their intentions through art, movement, and playful decision-making, fostering intention, planning skills, and the joy of working toward something meaningful.

## Vocabulary

**Strategy**: A smart plan or set of steps you decide ahead of time to help you accomplish something you want to do. When you think about what you need to do first, second, and third to reach your goal, you are creating a strategy.

**Intention**: What you decide you want to do or accomplish. It's your purpose or goal that you're thinking about. When you say "I want to build a tall tower," you are setting an intention.

**Progress**: Moving forward and getting closer to your goal, even if it's a tiny step. Progress is the movement you make toward accomplishing something, whether it's big or small.

**Persist**: To keep trying even when something is hard or when you don't succeed right away. When you persist, you don't give up—you keep working toward what you want.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will engage in creative, visual goal-setting through drawing, painting, or collage. They'll think about something they want to accomplish, represent it visually, and plan simple steps to reach it. This builds executive function, self-awareness, and confidence while allowing each child to express their unique intentions and learning style.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression / Hands-on planning / Visual thinking

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Large paper or poster board (12x18 inches or larger)—one per child
- Markers, crayons, or colored pencils in various colors
- Small objects (blocks, stones, pinecones) for concrete goal representation
- Stickers or stamps for celebration markers

**Optional**:
- Paint and brushes for larger visual expression
- Magazine pictures or printed images for collage
- Child-safe scissors
- String or tape to create visual "paths" to goals
- Glue stick or paste
- Index cards for writing/drawing individual steps
- Photos of the child to include in their plan

**Cost**: Free to under $10

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all materials and arrange on accessible table or outdoor surface with good lighting
2. Have paper and markers within easy reach of all children
3. Clear space for children to move around and view their planning work
4. Designate "creation station" and "celebration station"
5. Ensure cleaning supplies are ready (damp cloths, wipes, trash bin)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   "Today we're going to draw about something YOU want to do! Maybe you want to jump really high, build a tall tower, paint a beautiful picture, or dance. We'll draw our idea, and then think about what might help us do that. There's no 'right' picture—YOUR picture is perfect!" Ask children what they like to do or want to try. Show that goals can be small, silly, or big—all are wonderful.

2. **Exploration** (4-5 min):
   Let children think about their goal without pressure. Ask open-ended questions: "What do you love doing?" "What would make you proud?" "What's something you want to try?" For younger children (2-3), model simple goals like "I want to build blocks high" or "I want to dance and jump." Give children time to just think and play with materials before creating anything.

3. **Discovery** (8-12 min):
   Children draw or create a visual representation of their goal. Demonstrate: "I want to climb the playground, so I'm drawing the ladder and me going up." Support mark-making without correction—scribbles, lines, and shapes all represent thinking. Ask as they work: "What are you drawing?" "Tell me about your goal." Help children add themselves in the picture (figure, handprint, sticker). For non-verbal or younger children, work together collaboratively on the representation.

   Then add the "how"—what helps them reach this goal. Ask: "What do you need to help you with this?" or "What comes first?" Draw or add arrows showing the path. Keep it concrete and short (2-3 steps maximum for young children). As the adult, serve as a collaborator and scribe, not a director. Ask questions instead of giving answers. Notice and name what you see them thinking and planning.

4. **Wrap-up** (3-5 min):
   Gather children with their creations. Ask each child to share their goal: "Tell me about what you want to do." Add a celebration element: sticker, stamp, or marker flourish on their plan. Take a photo if desired. Discuss: "This is YOUR special plan. You thought about what you want and how to do it!" Make cleanup part of the learning—children can help sort materials back, celebrating their participation in caring for the space. Display plans somewhere special or send home with the child.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep goals very concrete and immediate: "build high," "paint," "run outside." Offer significant adult support as a co-creator. Use more pictures and symbols instead of words. Focus on one-step or two-step goals only. Emphasize doing the goal right after planning when possible. Use physical demonstration and modeling. Accept non-representational art—the scribble IS their plan. Duration: 15-20 minutes total.

**3-4+ years**:
Encourage more complex goals: "learn to climb the rope," "build a structure," "make up a dance." Support multi-step planning (3-5 small steps). Encourage children to think about obstacles: "What might be tricky? How can we help?" Add writing element if interested (simple labels or words for steps). Introduce the idea of "practicing" or "trying again" as part of goal-reaching. Support goal tracking by checking back on the plan later in the week. Duration: 25-30 minutes.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Goal Tracking and Celebration**
Return to the goal later in the week. Have children draw a checkmark or stamp on the plan if they've worked toward their goal. Celebrate attempts and progress, not just completion. Create a "Goal Wall" with multiple children's plans visible.

**Variation 2: Group Goal Setting**
Plan a group goal together: "We want to make a beautiful block tower" or "We want to dance and have fun." Create a large shared plan, discussing what each person brings to the goal. Celebrate the teamwork.

**Variation 3: Obstacle Problem-Solving**
After drawing the goal and steps, introduce a playful challenge: "What if you don't have the ladder?" "What if you're tired?" "What else could help?" Draw or add solutions to the plan, building creative problem-solving.

**Repeat play**: Return to goals throughout the week, celebrating progress and effort. Encourage children to attempt their goals and observe what happens. Document progress with photos or additional drawings.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't know what goal to set or says "I don't know"

**Solution**: Offer very concrete suggestions: "Do you want to build something? Jump? Paint? Dance?" Start with something they already love doing or just tried. Emphasize that it can be something small or silly. Sometimes the goal emerges during play—that's perfect too. Avoid pressure. Young children live in the present moment and may need adult scaffolding to think about intentions.

**Challenge**: Child draws something unrelated to their stated goal or "just scribbles"

**Solution**: Avoid correcting or redirecting. Ask questions: "Tell me about what you're making." Honor their creative choices. If they name their scribbles as their goal, that counts. Accept that the planning process looks different for each child. The process of planning is more important than the product.

**Challenge**: Child sets an impossible or unrealistic goal ("I want to fly," "I want to be a dinosaur")

**Solution**: Honor the imagination while gently exploring: "You want to fly! What helps things go up high? Ladders? Jumping? Let's draw you jumping really high!" Turn impossible goals into related real-world goals. Never shame magical thinking—it's beautiful and important at this age.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest or wants to move on quickly

**Solution**: Let them be done when they're done. Short planning sessions are still valuable. Some children show their planning through action rather than art—observe and celebrate that. Try again another day when they might be more engaged. Young children have shorter sustained attention.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Goal Return and Celebration**: A few days later, return to the goal and celebrate any progress, attempts, or practice toward it. Add stickers or marks showing what they've worked on.

2. **Model Your Own Goals**: Share your own simple goals out loud so children see how adults think about planning and strategies: "I want to organize these blocks, so first I'll gather them, then sort by color..."

3. **Goal-to-Action**: Use the planning as a springboard for actual play and goal-working. Draw the goal, then go do it together. This reinforces the connection between intention and action.
