# ARTS & CULTURE ACTIVITY: Strategic Planning and Goal Setting

## Activity Summary

Through creative goal-setting activities, children ages 2-4+ learn to think about what they want to accomplish, plan simple steps to get there, and celebrate their achievements. This activity builds executive function, self-awareness, and confidence by helping young children express their intentions through art, movement, and playful decision-making. Goal setting in early childhood is about fostering intention, planning skills, and the joy of working toward something meaningful.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression / Cognitive learning / Social-emotional development / Self-awareness practice

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- Start with simple enthusiasm: "Today we're going to draw about something YOU want to do!"
- Use relatable examples: "Maybe you want to jump really high, or build a tall tower, or paint a beautiful picture"
- Ask children what they like to do or want to try
- Show that goals can be small, silly, or big - all are wonderful

**Setting expectations**:
- "We're going to draw or paint our idea of something we want to do"
- "Then we'll think about what we need to help us do that"
- "There's no 'right' picture - YOUR picture is perfect!"
- Emphasize that this is about their thinking and dreaming, not perfection

### Main Activity (15-20 minutes)

**Phase 1: Exploration and dreaming** (4-5 minutes)
Let children think about their goal without pressure.
- Ask open-ended questions: "What do you love doing?" "What would make you proud?" "What's something you want to try?"
- Observe their responses without judgment
- For younger children (2-3), model simple goals like "I want to build blocks high" or "I want to dance and jump"
- Encourage silly, imaginative goals alongside realistic ones
- Give children time to just think and play with materials before creating

**Phase 2: Visual planning and creation** (8-12 minutes)
Child draws or creates a visual representation of their goal.
- Demonstrate: "I want to climb the playground, so I'm drawing the ladder and me going up"
- Support mark-making without correction: scribbles, lines, shapes all represent thinking
- Ask as they work: "What are you drawing?" "Tell me about your goal"
- Help children label parts with words or symbols if interested
- Encourage adding themselves in the picture (figure, handprint, sticker)
- For non-verbal or younger children, work together collaboratively on the representation

**Phase 3: Planning the steps** (4-6 minutes)
Add the "how" - what helps them reach this goal.
- Ask: "What do you need to help you with this?" or "What comes first?"
- Demonstrate simple steps: "First I need to find the ladder, then I climb one rung, then another rung..."
- Draw or add arrows showing the path to the goal
- Use pictures, words, or symbols to show these steps
- Keep it concrete and short (2-3 steps maximum for young children)
- Celebrate their thinking: "You really thought about how to do it!"

**Adult role**:
- Serve as a scribe and collaborator, not a director
- Ask questions instead of giving answers
- Notice and name what you see them thinking and planning
- Support confidence through authentic encouragement
- Allow for messiness and non-representational art
- Step back and let their vision lead, not your ideas
- Avoid perfectionism or correcting their drawing

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- Gather children with their creations
- Ask each child to share their goal: "Tell me about what you want to do"
- Add a celebration element: sticker, stamp, or marker flourish on their plan
- Take a photo of them with their plan if desired
- Discuss: "This is YOUR special plan. You thought about what you want and how to do it!"

**Transition to cleanup**:
- Make cleanup part of the learning: "Let's put our materials back carefully so they're ready for tomorrow"
- Children can help sort markers back into containers
- Celebrate their participation in caring for materials
- Display plans somewhere special or send home with child

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Approach**:
- Keep goals very concrete and immediate: "build high," "paint," "run outside"
- Offer significant adult support and scaffolding
- Use more pictures/symbols instead of words
- Focus on one-step or two-step goals (too many steps frustrates young learners)
- Emphasize doing the goal right after planning when possible
- Use physical demonstration and modeling
- Accept non-representational art - the scribble IS their plan

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes total, shorter phases

**Adult support**: High - plan and create together, adult as co-creator

### 3-4+ years
**Extensions**:
- Encourage more complex goals: "learn to climb the rope," "build a structure," "make up a dance"
- Support multi-step planning (3-5 small steps)
- Encourage children to think about obstacles: "What might be tricky? How can we help?"
- Add writing element if interested: simple labels or words for steps
- Introduce the idea of "practicing" or "trying again" as part of goal-reaching
- Support goal tracking: check back on the plan later in the week

**Duration**: 25-30 minutes - they sustain focus longer

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: Goal Tracking and Celebration**
Return to the goal later in the week. Have child draw a checkmark or stamp on the plan if they've worked toward their goal. Celebrate attempts and progress, not just completion. Create a "Goal Wall" with multiple children's plans visible.

**Variation 2: Group Goal Setting**
Plan a group goal together: "We want to make a beautiful block tower together" or "We want to dance and have fun." Create a large shared plan together, discussing what each person brings to the goal. Celebrate the teamwork.

**Variation 3: Obstacle Problem-Solving**
After drawing the goal and steps, introduce a playful challenge: "What if you don't have the ladder?" "What if you're tired?" "What else could help?" Draw or add solutions to the plan, building creative problem-solving.

**Variation 4: Goal Sequence Story**
Create a mini-story in pictures showing the journey from "not yet able" to "I can do it." Use a sequence of drawings with words if interested. This supports narrative thinking and resilience building.

**Thematic variations**:
- Seasonal goals: "What do you want to do in winter?" or "Spring outdoor goals"
- Holiday-themed: "What's something fun you want to try this holiday?"
- Interest-based: Goal-setting around a favorite book, animal, or activity
- Community goals: "What do we want to create together?"

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Goal setting is found across all cultures - the human impulse to envision a desired future and work toward it is universal. Indigenous cultures emphasize goals that benefit the community and connect to nature. Asian cultures often focus on persistent effort and gradual improvement. Western individualistic cultures may emphasize personal achievement. By introducing goal-setting playfully in early childhood, we honor this fundamental human capacity while respecting diverse cultural values about what makes a meaningful goal (personal achievement, family contribution, community service, spiritual growth, connection to nature, etc.).

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Discuss different types of goals people have: helping others, creating beauty, learning new skills, spending time with family, being healthy, protecting nature
- Share images or stories of people with diverse goals: athletes, artists, teachers, caretakers, scientists, craftspeople
- Acknowledge that goals look different in different families and cultures
- Celebrate goals that are about helping, caring, and community alongside individual achievements

**Books/Media**:
- "The Little Blue Truck" (Alice Schertle) - determination and goals
- "Rosie Revere, Engineer" (Andrea Beaty) - trying, failing, trying again toward a goal
- "Inch by Inch" (Leo Lionni) - persistence and measuring progress

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't know what goal to set or says "I don't know"
**Why**: Young children may not naturally think in terms of goals or futures; they live in the present moment. They may feel pressure or overwhelm at being asked to decide.
**Solution**: Offer very concrete suggestions: "Do you want to build something? Jump? Paint? Dance?" Start with something they already love doing or just tried. Emphasize that it can be something small or silly. Sometimes the goal emerges during play - that's perfect too.

**Challenge**: Child draws something unrelated to their stated goal or "just scribbles"
**Why**: Young children's artwork is often not representational; they're exploring materials and marks. Or they've moved on from the original idea. The process of planning is more important than the product.
**Solution**: Avoid correcting or redirecting. Ask questions: "Tell me about what you're making." Honor their creative choices. If they name their scribbles as their goal, that counts. Accept that the planning process looks different for each child.

**Challenge**: Child wants to set an impossible or unrealistic goal ("I want to fly," "I want to be a dinosaur")
**Why**: This is developmentally normal magical thinking. Young children haven't fully grasped what's physically possible.
**Solution**: Honor the imagination while gently exploring: "You want to fly! Let's think - what helps things go up high? Ladders? Jumping? Let's draw you jumping really high!" Turn impossible goals into related real-world goals. Never shame magical thinking - it's beautiful and important.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest or wants to move on quickly
**Why**: Young children have shorter sustained attention, or may be hungry, tired, or overstimulated. Some children prefer action to planning.
**Solution**: Let them be done when they're done. Short planning sessions are still valuable. Some children show their planning through action rather than art - observe and celebrate that. Try again another day when they might be more engaged.

### Tips for Success
- Start small and keep goals achievable in a reasonable timeframe (not "I want to learn piano" but "I want to make music with pots")
- Return to the goal a few days later and celebrate any progress, attempts, or practice
- Model your own simple goals and planning out loud so children see how adults think about goals
- Emphasize trying, practicing, and effort rather than success - "You worked really hard on that!"
- Use the planning as a springboard for actual play and goal-working: draw the goal, then go do it
- Some children will benefit from physical representation: collect materials for their goal, create a "goal path" with tape

### What to Do With the Creation
- Display prominently in the home or classroom where child can see it daily
- Take a photo and create a "Goal Portfolio" documenting their planning and progress over time
- Reference the plan during the week: "Remember your goal to build high? Want to try today?"
- Celebrate completion (or progress) by adding stickers, stamps, or a celebratory mark
- Keep as a memory of their thinking - these show beautiful cognitive development
- Some families like to create a "Goal Tree" or "Goal Wall" with multiple family members' plans displayed
- When the goal is accomplished, let the child decide whether to save it, celebrate it in a special way, or let it go
