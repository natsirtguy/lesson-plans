# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Strategic Planning and Goal Setting

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Children learn what planning actually is — a cognitive process where your brain simulates future events before they happen, identifies obstacles in advance, and organizes steps in sequence. Through drawing and building, they explore the same cognitive toolkit used by engineers, architects, coaches, and surgeons: decomposing big goals into steps, predicting what might go wrong, and adjusting plans based on feedback. Strategic planning is a core executive function skill — and like all skills, it gets better with practice.

## Vocabulary

**Executive Function**: A set of mental skills managed by the prefrontal cortex (the front of your brain) that let you plan, focus, remember instructions, and control impulses. Planning is a core executive function. Other executive functions include working memory and inhibitory control. These skills develop throughout childhood and can be strengthened through practice.

**Mental Simulation**: When your brain imagines a future event before it happens — "if I stack the big block on the small one, what will happen?" This is what planning is, at a cognitive level. Humans are unusually good at mental simulation compared to other animals, and it's one reason we can build complex things.

**Decomposition**: Breaking a big, complex goal into smaller, manageable steps. "Build a robot" is too big to act on. "Find a box → find tubes → tape them together → decorate" is decomposed. Engineers, architects, and surgeons all use decomposition constantly.

**Obstacle Anticipation**: Thinking ahead about what might go wrong before starting. A good plan includes not just steps, but also "what if..." contingencies. This is sometimes called a "pre-mortem" — imagining the plan failed and asking why.

**Strategy**: A chosen approach to reaching a goal, selected from multiple possible approaches. A strategy is specific: not just "I'll try harder" but "I'll start with the heaviest blocks at the bottom so the tower is stable."

**Persist / Iterate**: To keep trying and adjust based on what you learn. Plans rarely work perfectly on the first try — the response to failure is to gather information and iterate (try a modified version). This is how scientists, artists, and engineers all work.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes

**Tempo**: Moderate and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 4 lines each):

*Verse 1*

I can plan, I can dream, I can dream,
I can plan, I can dream, I can dream,
Think about what I want to do,
And I'll make a plan to see it through!

*Verse 2*

First I start, then I go, then I go,
First I start, then I go, then I go,
I can try and I can grow every day,
Working toward my goal in every way!

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will engage in creative, visual goal-setting through drawing, painting, or collage. They'll think about something they want to accomplish, represent it visually, and plan simple steps to reach it. This builds executive function, self-awareness, and confidence while allowing each child to express their unique intentions and learning style.

**Activity Type**: Creative expression / Hands-on planning / Visual thinking

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Large paper or poster board (12x18 inches or larger)—one per child
- Markers, crayons, or colored pencils in various colors
- Small objects (blocks, stones, pinecones) for concrete goal representation
- Stickers or stamps for celebration markers

**Optional**:
- Paint and brushes for larger visual expression
- Magazine pictures or printed images for collage
- Child-safe scissors
- String or tape to create visual "paths" to goals
- Glue stick or paste
- Index cards for writing/drawing individual steps
- Photos of the child to include in their plan

**Cost**: Free to under $10

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather all materials and arrange on accessible table or outdoor surface with good lighting
2. Have paper and markers within easy reach of all children
3. Clear space for children to move around and view their planning work
4. Designate "creation station" and "celebration station"
5. Ensure cleaning supplies are ready (damp cloths, wipes, trash bin)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction: What is a plan?** (3-4 min):
   Start with a concrete real-world example: "Before a builder makes a house, they draw a picture of what it will look like — that's called a blueprint. Before a cook makes a meal, they think about which step comes first. Before a soccer team plays, the coach thinks about where each player should stand — that's a strategy." "Planning is your brain imagining something before it happens. Let's practice using our planning brains."

2. **Decomposition practice** (4-5 min):
   Pick one concrete goal together (building a tall block tower works well). Ask: "What do we need to do to make a really tall tower that doesn't fall?" Together, identify steps: find flat blocks for the base, put biggest blocks at the bottom, place each one carefully, go slowly near the top. "We just decomposed our goal — broke it into pieces. Each piece is a step." Now ask: "What might go wrong?" (It might fall, we might run out of blocks.) "A good plan thinks about that in advance."

3. **Drawing phase** (8-12 min):
   Children draw or represent their own goal — something they actually want to do or build today or this week. For each child, guide them through decomposition: "What's step one? What comes after that? What could go wrong, and what would you do?" Draw or write steps together (caregiver can write words while child draws). Keep to 3-5 steps maximum. Encourage specificity: not just "build a tower" but "build a tower that reaches the shelf."

   Ask: "Can your brain picture what it will look like when you're done? That's mental simulation — your brain is practicing in advance."

4. **Attempt and feedback** (if time allows, 5-7 min):
   Try to actually execute the plan. Observe together whether it works. "The plan said to put big blocks on the bottom. What happened? Did the plan work? What would you change?" This closes the loop: plan → act → observe → revise. Even a partial or failed attempt is perfect — it gives information for iteration.

5. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   "What did we just do? We had a goal, we decomposed it into steps, we thought about obstacles, we tried it, and we noticed what happened." Name the executive function: "This is called strategic planning. Architects, doctors, generals, engineers — they all do this same thing, just with bigger goals." Review the vocabulary: decomposition, mental simulation, iteration.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep goals very concrete and immediate: "build a tall tower," "paint something red," "jump over the pillow." Do the planning conversation verbally, with the adult as scribe/drawer. Focus on two steps: "First we do this, then we do that." After planning, immediately execute — the connection between plan and action is the learning. Introduce one vocabulary word: "step." Say "What's the first step?" and "What's the next step?" regularly. When something doesn't work, say "Let's iterate — let's try again a different way."

**3-4+ years**:
Introduce decomposition explicitly: "Let's decompose this goal into steps." Use 4-5 steps. Introduce obstacle anticipation: "Before we start, what might go wrong?" This is sophisticated metacognitive thinking, and four-year-olds can do it. Let them lead the planning conversation with you as facilitator. Ask: "Can you picture in your head what it will look like when we're done?" Discuss that this mental picture is what guides planning. Connect to real-world examples: "Architects make blueprints before buildings. Scientists make hypotheses before experiments. What's your hypothesis — your prediction — about whether this plan will work?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Goal Tracking and Celebration**
Return to the goal later in the week. Have children draw a checkmark or stamp on the plan if they've worked toward their goal. Celebrate attempts and progress, not just completion. Create a "Goal Wall" with multiple children's plans visible.

**Variation 2: Group Goal Setting**
Plan a group goal together: "We want to make a beautiful block tower" or "We want to dance and have fun." Create a large shared plan, discussing what each person brings to the goal. Celebrate the teamwork.

**Variation 3: Obstacle Problem-Solving**
After drawing the goal and steps, introduce a playful challenge: "What if you don't have the ladder?" "What if you're tired?" "What else could help?" Draw or add solutions to the plan, building creative problem-solving.

**Repeat play**: Return to goals throughout the week, celebrating progress and effort. Encourage children to attempt their goals and observe what happens. Document progress with photos or additional drawings.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't know what goal to set or says "I don't know"

**Solution**: Offer very concrete suggestions: "Do you want to build something? Jump? Paint? Dance?" Start with something they already love doing or just tried. Emphasize that it can be something small or silly. Sometimes the goal emerges during play—that's perfect too. Avoid pressure. Young children live in the present moment and may need adult scaffolding to think about intentions.

**Challenge**: Child draws something unrelated to their stated goal or "just scribbles"

**Solution**: Avoid correcting or redirecting. Ask questions: "Tell me about what you're making." Honor their creative choices. If they name their scribbles as their goal, that counts. Accept that the planning process looks different for each child. The process of planning is more important than the product.

**Challenge**: Child sets an impossible or unrealistic goal ("I want to fly," "I want to be a dinosaur")

**Solution**: Honor the imagination while gently exploring: "You want to fly! What helps things go up high? Ladders? Jumping? Let's draw you jumping really high!" Turn impossible goals into related real-world goals. Never shame magical thinking—it's beautiful and important at this age.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest or wants to move on quickly

**Solution**: Let them be done when they're done. Short planning sessions are still valuable. Some children show their planning through action rather than art—observe and celebrate that. Try again another day when they might be more engaged. Young children have shorter sustained attention.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Goal Return and Celebration**: A few days later, return to the goal and celebrate any progress, attempts, or practice toward it. Add stickers or marks showing what they've worked on.

2. **Model Your Own Goals**: Share your own simple goals out loud so children see how adults think about planning and strategies: "I want to organize these blocks, so first I'll gather them, then sort by color..."

3. **Goal-to-Action**: Use the planning as a springboard for actual play and goal-working. Draw the goal, then go do it together. This reinforces the connection between intention and action.
