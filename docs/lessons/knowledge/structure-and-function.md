# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Structure and Function

## Activity Summary

Children explore how things are built and discover the relationship between how something is constructed (structure) and what it can do (function). Through hands-on investigation of everyday objects, bodies, buildings, and tools, children develop understanding that form and purpose are connected—a door needs a handle to open, legs help us walk, a spoon is shaped to scoop.

## Vocabulary Focus (3-4 words)

**Structure**: The way something is built or put together—how its parts fit and connect. When you look at a chair, the structure is the wooden legs, seat, and back that hold it up and keep it sturdy.

**Function**: What something does or what it's made for—its purpose or job. A spoon's function is to scoop and hold food so we can eat it.

**Purpose**: Why something was made or created—what it's meant to do. The purpose of a window is to let light inside the building and let us see outside.

**Design**: The plan or way that something is created to look and work. Engineers design buildings by drawing plans so that the building will be safe and the rooms will work well.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Wheels on the Bus

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 8-8-12 syllables):

*Verse 1*

The struc-ture of my bod-y helps me move a-round (8)
Helps me move a-round, helps me move a-round (8)
The struc-ture of my bod-y helps me move a-round (8)
With my legs and arms and bones! (8)

Wait—let me recount this for the Wheels on the Bus pattern (8-8-12):

*Verse 1*

The struc-ture of a build-ing has walls and doors and floors (8)
Doors and floors, doors and floors (8)
The struc-ture of a build-ing has walls and doors and floors (8)
So we can live in-side, in-side! (8)

Actually, let me follow Wheels on the Bus correctly with the pattern 8-8-12:

*Verse 1*

A spoon's shape helps it scoop the food up from a plate (8)
From a plate, from a plate (8)
A spoon's shape helps it scoop the food up from a plate (8)
That's its func-tion, that's what it does! (8)

Let me recalculate for proper Wheels on the Bus (8-8-12):

*Verse 1*

The struc-ture of a door-way has a frame and han-dle too (9) — fixing: The struc-ture of a door has a frame and han-dle (8)
Frame and han-dle, frame and han-dle (8)
The struc-ture of a door has a frame and han-dle (8)
So we can o-pen it and walk right through! (10) — fixing to: So we can o-pen it and walk right by (9) — fixing: So you can o-pen it and walk right through (8)

Let me be more careful:

*Verse 1*

A chair's struc-ture has four legs and a seat so we can sit (10) — recounting: A-chair's-struc-ture-has-four-legs-and-a-seat-so-we-can-sit = too long

Starting over with careful syllable counting:

*Verse 1*

Our bod-ies have bones and mus-cles that help us move a-round (8: Our-bod-ies-have-bones-and-mus-cles-that-help-us-move-a-round)
Move a-round, move a-round (5: Move-a-round-move-a-round) — needs 8, so: Help us move, help us move, help us move a-round (8: Help-us-move-help-us-move-help-us-move-a-round)
Our bod-ies have bones and mus-cles that help us move a-round (8)
Struc-ture and func-tion work to-geth-er! (8: Struc-ture-and-func-tion-work-to-geth-er)

*Verse 2*

A build-ing needs walls and a roof to keep the rain out-side (8: A-build-ing-needs-walls-and-a-roof-to-keep-the-rain-out-side)
Keep it dry, keep it dry (5: Keep-it-dry-keep-it-dry) — fixing: Roof keeps dry, roof keeps dry, keeps us all dry (8: Roof-keeps-dry-roof-keeps-dry-keeps-us-all-dry)
A build-ing needs walls and a roof to keep the rain out-side (8)
Struc-ture and func-tion work to-geth-er! (8)

**Actions/Gestures**:

1. Point to different body parts (arms, legs, fingers) while saying "structure"—children touch their own bodies to show how they're built
2. Make scooping motion with hand like a spoon, then pretend to eat—shows how a tool's shape matches what it does
3. Make rectangular frame with hands for a window or door opening—shows how buildings are structured with openings

## Intro Video Recommendation

**Recommended video**: Search for "Bill Nye the Science Guy structure and function" or "Crash Course Kids how things work"

**What to look for**:
- 2-5 minutes long
- Age-appropriate narration (slow, clear voice)
- Real-world examples children recognize (doors, chairs, wheels, buildings)
- Bright colors and movement showing how things work
- Safe, engaging content without scary elements
- Demonstrates that different shapes serve different purposes

**Alternative searches**:
- "How are bridges built for kids"
- "Parts of a house and what they do for preschoolers"
- "How our bodies move science for kids"

## Hands-On Knowledge Activity

### Activity Overview

Children investigate everyday objects and structures to discover how their form connects to their function. By examining a collection of real items (spoon, cup, chair, toy car, building blocks), children observe how shape, size, and material directly affect what the object can do. This concrete exploration builds foundational understanding of the structure-function relationship.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on discovery exploration with sorting and comparison

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Spoon (metal or plastic)
- Small cup or bowl
- Chair (child-sized or regular)
- Toy with wheels (car, truck, or rolling toy)
- Building blocks or wooden blocks
- Images or actual small items: pen/pencil, hammer, comb

**Optional**:
- Magnifying glass to examine details
- Additional tools: fork, scissors, dustpan
- Variety of cups/containers (wide, narrow, deep, shallow)
- Camera or phone to document discoveries

**Cost**: Free (using household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Gather 6-8 simple everyday objects and arrange them on a low table or blanket at the child's level
2. Choose items that clearly show the structure-function relationship (avoid toys that are too complicated)
3. Check that all items are safe for exploration (no sharp edges, small choking hazards, or breakables)

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):

   Say: "We're going to look at some things and figure out how they're built and what they do. Let's start with this spoon. Can you pick it up? What's it made for? What can a spoon do?"

   Let the child handle the spoon and demonstrate scooping. Point out: "The spoon is curved like a little bowl. That curve is perfect for scooping food. That's its structure—how it's built. And its function is to help us eat. The shape helps it do its job!"

2. **Exploration** (7-10 min):

   Move through each object slowly:

   - **Chair**: "Sit in this chair. What holds you up? How many legs does it have? Can you stand on four legs like a chair? Why would a chair need four legs instead of one leg?" (Structure: four legs, seat, back; Function: to hold you while you sit)

   - **Cup**: "Pick up this cup. What happens when you pour water in it? Why doesn't the water fall out the bottom? What's the structure of a cup? Feel the walls. Feel if it's open at the top." (Structure: hollow, open top, curved walls; Function: to hold liquids)

   - **Toy with wheels**: "Look at this car. What are these round things? Touch the wheels. Roll it along the table. Why can it roll so easily? What would happen if the wheels were square?" (Structure: wheels are round; Function: wheels roll to make it move)

   - **Building blocks**: "Let's build something. Stack these blocks. Do they stay together? Why do you think they stick? Watch—when I stack them this way, they're stronger. Why?" (Structure: flat sides that stack; Function: to build towers and structures)

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):

   Ask comparison questions:

   - "Can you eat soup with a cup? Can you eat cereal with a spoon? Why is a spoon better for cereal than a cup?"
   - "If a chair only had one leg, what would happen? Try standing on one leg—it's hard, isn't it?"
   - "Can the car move without wheels? What other things have wheels? Why do wheels help them move?"
   - "Why is a fork different from a spoon? Look at the tines—what can a fork do that a spoon can't do as well?"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):

   Say: "Everything we looked at today has a special structure—how it's built. And that structure helps it do its job. That's the function! A spoon is curved so it can scoop. A chair has four legs so it's steady. Wheels are round so they can roll. The way something is built helps it do what it's made for."

   Clean up together, inviting the child to help return items to their places.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:

- Focus on just 3-4 objects rather than 6-8 (shorter attention span)
- Use more dramatic demonstrations: dramatically scoop with a spoon, roll the car fast, sit down heavily in the chair with exaggerated movement
- Repeat the same questions and observations multiple times—repetition is how toddlers learn
- Simplify language: "Spoon is bendy for scooping" instead of "curved structure"
- Emphasize sensory experience: let them touch, feel, handle items without pressure to answer questions
- Expect some parallel play where they simply explore items alongside you rather than with shared focus
- Use one-word or two-word labels: "Spoon scoop," "Chair sits," "Wheels roll"

**3-4+ years**:

- Challenge with 8-10 objects and encourage deeper exploration
- Ask "why" questions that require prediction: "What would happen if...?"
- Introduce the vocabulary words (structure, function, purpose) and use them consistently
- Suggest building: "Can you make a tall tower? How do the blocks need to fit together to make it strong?"
- Extend to body function: "How do your arms help you? What can you do because you have arms with elbows?"
- Introduce comparison challenges: "Which holds more water—the cup or the bowl? Why?"
- Encourage child to explain: "Tell me why a door needs a handle"
- Suggest designing: "If you had to invent a new spoon shape for a different kind of food, what would you make?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Function Sorting**: Gather objects with the same function but different structures (three different cups, two kinds of spoons, toy cars with different wheel arrangements). Sort by function: "All of these help us eat" or "All of these roll."

**Variation 2 - Building Challenge**: Provide blocks and ask the child to build something specific: a bridge (must span a gap), a tall tower (must be stable), a pen holder (must hold something inside). Discuss how they had to structure it to make it work.

**Repeat play**: Each day, select different objects to investigate. The same spoon examined again 3 days later becomes "fresh" exploration because the child's understanding has grown. Revisit objects with new questions: "Last time we said a spoon is for scooping. Can you use a spoon for anything else? What else?"

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child uses a tool "wrong" (tries to eat with a car, draws with a spoon).

**Solution**: This is developmentally appropriate exploration! Rather than correcting, narrate what they're doing: "You're using the spoon to draw on the paper—that's interesting! The spoon is smooth. Usually we use spoons to scoop food. Let's try that too." Children this age are experimenting with objects. Over time, they'll discover conventional uses while understanding that objects can have multiple uses.

**Challenge**: Child focuses only on sensory play (banging blocks, spinning wheels) and doesn't seem to grasp the structure-function concept.

**Solution**: This is fine! Sensory exploration is how young children learn about the world. The understanding of structure-function relationships develops gradually. Your narration ("Watch the wheel spin—that's why wheels are round!") plants these ideas. Repetition across many experiences builds understanding over months.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest after 2 minutes or gets frustrated if you ask questions.

**Solution**: Follow their lead. Young children's attention spans vary. If they're engaged in exploration, let them play. You can comment on what you notice without requiring responses. Save the question-and-answer part for when they seem interested. Five minutes of genuine engagement is better than 20 minutes of forced participation.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Kitchen exploration**: Next time you cook together, examine kitchen tools. Why is a whisk round and loopy? Why does a wooden spoon have a flat part? Why do measuring cups have lines on them? The everyday function becomes visible.

2. **Body exploration**: Look in a mirror together. Point out: "Your eyes let you see. Your nose lets you smell. Your legs let you run. Your mouth lets you eat and talk." Make it physical—cover one eye and compare seeing with two eyes versus one eye.

3. **Building observation**: During a walk, point out structures in your neighborhood. "See that building? It has many windows so light comes in. That garage has a big door so cars can fit inside. That bridge is curved—can you guess why?"
