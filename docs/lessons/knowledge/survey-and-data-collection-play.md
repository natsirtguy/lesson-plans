# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Survey and Data Collection Play

## Activity Summary

In this lesson, children learn the basics of gathering information by asking simple questions and recording answers. Through interactive surveys and data collection activities, children develop questioning skills, learn to observe and record information, and discover how data helps us understand what people like and prefer.

## Vocabulary

**Survey**: A set of questions you ask people to find out what they like, think, or prefer. For example, asking your friends "Do you like apples or bananas?" is a simple survey.

**Data**: Information and facts that we collect and gather. When you ask five friends their favorite color and write down the answers, that collection of colors is your data.

**Collect**: To gather things together in one place. When you pick up different toys and put them in a basket, you are collecting them. We collect data by gathering answers and information.

**Observe**: To watch carefully and notice things. When you look closely at flowers to see which ones are red, purple, or yellow, you are observing the flowers.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Row, Row, Row Your Boat

**Tempo**: Moderate and cheerful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Ask, ask, ask your friends
Survey what they say
Collect the data carefully
Observe it every day

*Verse 2*
Mark, mark, mark the chart
Data that we find
Surveys help us understand
What's on people's minds

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Cup hand to ear and gesture outward when singing "ask your friends"
2. Pretend to place stickers or marks on a chart during "mark the chart"
3. Point to eyes during "observe" and tap your head during "what's on people's minds"

## Intro Video Recommendation

**Recommended video**: Search YouTube for "preschool survey activities for toddlers" or "data collection for young children"

**What to look for**:
- 2-5 minutes long
- Shows simple questions being asked and answered
- Visual representation of results (pictures, stickers, or tallies)
- Encourages children to participate
- Cheerful, calm narration
- Uses concrete objects or pictures children can relate to

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will create and conduct a simple survey about their favorite things (colors, foods, animals, or toys). They'll ask friends or family members to respond, then collect the answers using stickers, tallies, or pictures. Finally, they'll look at their results together and talk about what they learned from their survey.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on survey and data collection with visual recording

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper or cardboard for survey chart
- Markers, crayons, or colored pencils
- Stickers OR small tokens (buttons, blocks, etc.) for marking answers
- 3-4 simple answer choices (pictures or words)

**Optional**:
- Pictures cut from magazines
- Whiteboard and dry-erase markers for easy erasing
- Simple icons or emojis printed out
- Tape or clipboard to make chart portable

**Cost**: Free (using household items) to under $5 (if purchasing stickers)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Choose a simple survey question with 2-3 answer options (e.g., "Do you like apples or oranges?" "Is your favorite color red, yellow, or blue?" "Do you have a dog, cat, or other pet?")
2. Draw a simple chart on paper with the question at the top and answer options down the side or across the top
3. Have stickers, markers, or tokens ready to place on the chart
4. Test your chart with one person to make sure it's easy to use

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Sit with the child and explain: "We're going to ask people a question and write down what they say. This is called a survey." Show them the chart and explain each answer choice with a picture or word. Let them practice placing a sticker or mark on the chart as an example.

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   Have the child ask the survey question to 3-6 family members, friends, or their stuffed animals. For each answer, guide them to place a sticker, mark a tally, or color a square on the chart. Encourage them to say the answer out loud as they record it: "Grandma likes apples, so we put a sticker here!"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Once several answers are collected, look at the chart together. Ask questions: "Which answer has the most stickers? Which has the least? Do you like that answer too? How many people said apples? How many said oranges?" Point out the patterns and what the data shows.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Celebrate completing the survey together. Display the chart so people can see the results. Talk about what you learned: "Most people like red!" or "Everyone has a pet!" This reinforces that surveys help us learn about what people think.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep surveys very simple with only 2 choices. Use pictures instead of words. Do a shorter survey with just 2-3 people. Focus on the physical act of placing stickers rather than analyzing data. Use real objects (real apples and oranges to choose between) rather than pictures. Let them take the lead in asking, even if the question isn't perfectly clear.

**3-4+ years**:
Offer 3-4 answer choices. Help them write or draw responses themselves. Conduct longer surveys with more people (5-8 responses). Ask more analytical questions: "Why do you think most people chose that?" "Can you count how many people said yes?" Introduce simple tallying or grouping. Create multiple surveys on different topics over time and compare results.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Food Survey**: Ask "What's your favorite snack - crackers, fruit, or cheese?" while snack time approaches, then serve the most popular choice

**Variation 2 - Pet Survey**: Ask "Do you like dogs, cats, or fish?" and use animal pictures. If possible, show photos of different pets

**Variation 3 - Repeat Play**: Conduct the same survey weekly with new people to see if answers change. Create a new survey each time you play (favorite toy, favorite song, favorite game)

**Variation 4 - Body Survey**: Ask preference questions about movement - "Do you like to jump, spin, or dance?" Then do those activities

**Repeat play**: Rotate survey topics weekly. Let the child choose the next question. Invite different people (grandparents, friends, siblings) to answer surveys and increase variety

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't ask the question clearly or forgets to ask it at all.

**Solution**: Repeat the question together several times before you begin. Say it in a sing-song voice. Have them point to the question on the paper while asking it. It's okay if they ask in their own words - the point is the interaction, not perfect phrasing.

**Challenge**: Child wants to mark multiple answers or places marks randomly without meaning.

**Solution**: Slow down and do one person at a time. Ask them to repeat the answer they heard before marking it. Use your finger to help guide them to the right spot. Keep it structured and calm.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest before collecting many responses.

**Solution**: Start with just asking 2-3 people instead of many. Make it social and celebratory - clap after each response! Survey stuffed animals or toys to add fun and variety. Do shorter surveys more frequently rather than one long survey.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand what the completed survey means.

**Solution**: Use concrete language - "Look! Lots of stickers here! That means many people like apples." Point to the visual differences. Count aloud: "One, two, three people like red!" Let them physically move stickers or tokens to see differences more clearly.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Graph the results**: Take a photo of the completed survey chart and print it out. Recreate it with physical objects (snacks, blocks) arranged to show the data visually

2. **Compare surveys**: If you do multiple surveys over time, look at the results together - "Last week more people liked red. This week more people like blue. What changed?"

3. **Real-world data**: Point out surveys and data in daily life - "The store put the apples in a big pile because many people buy them" or "This song is playing everywhere because lots of people like it"
