# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Survey and Data Collection Play

## Activity Summary

In this lesson, children learn the basics of gathering information by asking simple questions and recording answers. Through interactive surveys and data collection activities, children develop questioning skills, learn to observe and record information, and discover how data helps us understand what people like and prefer.

## Vocabulary

**Survey**: A set of questions you ask a *sample* of people to learn about what a larger group thinks. Scientists, businesses, and governments all use surveys to make decisions. A doctor might survey 1,000 patients before recommending a new medicine.

**Data**: The information collected from a survey or experiment. Data can be counted, sorted, and visualized. When you ask five friends their favorite color and write down the answers, those answers are your data — and you can now do math on them.

**Tally**: A counting method using marks — each answer gets a mark (|), and every fifth mark crosses the others (||||). Tallying is a real mathematical tool used to keep track of counts quickly without losing your place.

**Sample**: The group of people you actually survey. If you ask 3 family members, your sample is 3. Scientists want large, *representative* samples — asking only toddlers gives different results than asking people of all ages. This is called *sample bias*.

**Frequency**: How often each answer appears in your data. If 4 people choose apples and 1 chooses oranges, apples have a *higher frequency*. A *frequency distribution* shows all the frequencies at once — that's what a bar chart displays.

**Prediction**: Using data to make an educated guess about the future. If 8 out of 10 people in your survey prefer dogs, you can *predict* that the next person you survey is more likely to prefer dogs too.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Row, Row, Row Your Boat

**Tempo**: Moderate and cheerful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Ask, ask, ask your friends
Survey what they say
Collect the data carefully
Observe it every day

*Verse 2*
Mark, mark, mark the chart
Data that we find
Surveys help us understand
What's on people's minds

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Cup hand to ear and gesture outward when singing "ask your friends"
2. Pretend to place stickers or marks on a chart during "mark the chart"
3. Point to eyes during "observe" and tap your head during "what's on people's minds"

## Intro Video Recommendation

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will create and conduct a simple survey about their favorite things (colors, foods, animals, or toys). They'll ask friends or family members to respond, then collect the answers using stickers, tallies, or pictures. Finally, they'll look at their results together and talk about what they learned from their survey.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on survey and data collection with visual recording

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Paper or cardboard for survey chart
- Markers, crayons, or colored pencils
- Stickers OR small tokens (buttons, blocks, etc.) for marking answers
- 3-4 simple answer choices (pictures or words)

**Optional**:
- Pictures cut from magazines
- Whiteboard and dry-erase markers for easy erasing
- Simple icons or emojis printed out
- Tape or clipboard to make chart portable

**Cost**: Free (using household items) to under $5 (if purchasing stickers)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Choose a simple survey question with 2-3 answer options (e.g., "Do you like apples or oranges?" "Is your favorite color red, yellow, or blue?" "Do you have a dog, cat, or other pet?")
2. Draw a simple chart on paper with the question at the top and answer options down the side or across the top
3. Have stickers, markers, or tokens ready to place on the chart
4. Test your chart with one person to make sure it's easy to use

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   "Did you know scientists, doctors, and businesses all collect data to make decisions? When companies want to know which cereal kids like best, they survey hundreds of children. When scientists study how much sleep people need, they survey thousands of people. Today we're going to be data scientists! We're going to create a survey, collect data, and then analyze what the data tells us." Show the chart. Explain that each answer they record is a *data point*, and when tallied up, the data shows a *frequency distribution* — which answer is most common. Let them practice placing a tally mark.

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   Have the child ask the survey question to 3-6 family members, friends, or their stuffed animals. For each answer, guide them to place a sticker, mark a tally, or color a square on the chart. Encourage them to say the answer out loud as they record it: "Grandma likes apples, so we put a sticker here!"

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Once several answers are collected, analyze the data together: "Which answer has the most tally marks? That one has the *highest frequency* — it appeared most often in our data." Count each group: "Apples: 3. Oranges: 1. Bananas: 2." Now predict: "If we asked one MORE person, which answer do you think they'd give? Why? We can't know for sure, but the data gives us a clue!" Introduce sample bias: "What if we only asked children? Do you think adults would answer the same way? That's called *sample bias* — who you ask changes what your data shows."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Celebrate completing the survey together. Display the chart so people can see the results. Talk about what you learned: "Most people like red!" or "Everyone has a pet!" This reinforces that surveys help us learn about what people think.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep surveys very simple with only 2 choices. Use pictures instead of words. Do a shorter survey with just 2-3 people. Focus on the physical act of placing stickers rather than analyzing data. Use real objects (real apples and oranges to choose between) rather than pictures. Let them take the lead in asking, even if the question isn't perfectly clear.

**3-4+ years**:
Offer 3-4 answer choices. Help them write or draw responses themselves. Conduct longer surveys with more people (5-8 responses). Ask more analytical questions: "Why do you think most people chose that?" "Can you count how many people said yes?" Introduce simple tallying or grouping. Create multiple surveys on different topics over time and compare results.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Food Survey**: Ask "What's your favorite snack - crackers, fruit, or cheese?" while snack time approaches, then serve the most popular choice

**Variation 2 - Pet Survey**: Ask "Do you like dogs, cats, or fish?" and use animal pictures. If possible, show photos of different pets

**Variation 3 - Repeat Play**: Conduct the same survey weekly with new people to see if answers change. Create a new survey each time you play (favorite toy, favorite song, favorite game)

**Variation 4 - Body Survey**: Ask preference questions about movement - "Do you like to jump, spin, or dance?" Then do those activities

**Repeat play**: Rotate survey topics weekly. Let the child choose the next question. Invite different people (grandparents, friends, siblings) to answer surveys and increase variety

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't ask the question clearly or forgets to ask it at all.

**Solution**: Repeat the question together several times before you begin. Say it in a sing-song voice. Have them point to the question on the paper while asking it. It's okay if they ask in their own words - the point is the interaction, not perfect phrasing.

**Challenge**: Child wants to mark multiple answers or places marks randomly without meaning.

**Solution**: Slow down and do one person at a time. Ask them to repeat the answer they heard before marking it. Use your finger to help guide them to the right spot. Keep it structured and calm.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest before collecting many responses.

**Solution**: Start with just asking 2-3 people instead of many. Make it social and celebratory - clap after each response! Survey stuffed animals or toys to add fun and variety. Do shorter surveys more frequently rather than one long survey.

**Challenge**: Child doesn't understand what the completed survey means.

**Solution**: Use concrete language - "Look! Lots of stickers here! That means many people like apples." Point to the visual differences. Count aloud: "One, two, three people like red!" Let them physically move stickers or tokens to see differences more clearly.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Graph the results**: Take a photo of the completed survey chart and print it out. Recreate it with physical objects (snacks, blocks) arranged to show the data visually

2. **Compare surveys**: If you do multiple surveys over time, look at the results together - "Last week more people liked red. This week more people like blue. What changed?"

3. **Real-world data**: Point out surveys and data in daily life - "The store put the apples in a big pile because many people buy them" or "This song is playing everywhere because lots of people like it"
