# Sustainability Basics

## Activity Summary

Children will explore the concept of caring for our planet through simple, sensory activities that demonstrate how we can reduce waste and protect nature. Through hands-on discovery, they'll learn that our choices matter and that even small actions help take care of Earth.

## Vocabulary Focus (3-4 words)

**Sustainable**: Something that we can use and repeat over and over without harming the Earth. Like using a cloth bag many times instead of throwing away plastic bags each time we go shopping.

**Biodegradable**: Something that can break down naturally and return to the soil, like apple peels or fallen leaves, without polluting our planet.

**Conserve**: To use something carefully and wisely so we don't waste it. When we conserve water, we use just enough to wash our hands without letting it run everywhere.

**Repurpose**: To give something old a new use instead of throwing it away. An empty jar becomes a container for crayons, or old t-shirts become stuffed toys.

## Hands-On Knowledge Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will sort items into "keep using," "recycle," and "compost" categories while learning about waste reduction. Through this sensory sorting game, they'll discover that many things we use every day can have a second life, and that nature breaks down some materials safely.

**Activity Type**: Sorting activity with sensory exploration

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- 3 baskets, bins, or paper bags labeled with pictures (keep using, recycle, compost)
- 10-15 household items (plastic bottle, glass jar, paper, cardboard box, aluminum foil, apple core, paper towel, plastic bag, wooden spoon, cloth napkin, banana peel, newspaper, plastic cup, egg carton, leaves)
- Pictures or symbols for each category (drawn or printed)

**Optional**:
- Child-safe gardening gloves
- Compost bin or soil
- Labels with words and pictures
- Camera to document sorting

**Cost**: Free (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Collect 10-15 safe household items and place them in a central pile or basket
2. Set up 3 baskets or bins in a line, labeled with pictures: green leaf (compost), blue circle (recycle), yellow star (keep using/reuse)
3. Wash all items thoroughly; ensure nothing is sharp or unsafe for handling

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Begin by showing the three baskets and explaining simply: "Some things come from nature and go back to nature (point to compost). Some things can sleep and wake up as something new (point to recycle). And some things we can use again and again (point to keep using)."

   Show one example for each category: "Apple core goes to nature, bottle can be recycled, and this spoon we use again."

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   Invite the child to pick up one item at a time and decide where it belongs. Ask guiding questions: "Is this something that came from nature and can go back to nature?" "Can this take a nap and become something new?" "Can we use this again?"

   Let them place each item in the basket they choose. Celebrate each choice, even if incorrect—this is about learning, not perfection.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Talk about what you see together. "Look how many things can be recycled! That means less garbage in the ground." Point out items that can be used again: "This cloth napkin can be washed and used at lunch tomorrow!"

   If you have a real compost bin or soil, show what happens to the food waste: "These scraps will mix with soil and help plants grow."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Together, move the "keep using" items back to their homes, put recycling in the bin, and compost items in the appropriate place. Say: "We helped take care of Earth by sorting carefully. Thank you!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use only 5-6 items and simplify to two categories: "nature" (compost—leaves, food scraps) and "use again" (plastic containers, cloth items). Use large pictures and symbols rather than words. Keep explanations very short: "Apple goes with soil. Cup goes with other cups." Physical assistance is welcome.

**3-4+ years**:
Use the full 3-basket system and introduce the word "recycle" with explanation. Ask more complex questions: "What do you think this could become if we recycle it?" Invite them to research or predict what recycled items become. Challenge them to find items around the house that belong in each category.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Classroom Sorting**: Do this activity daily at snack time or cleanup, having children sort their food waste and packaging. Create a simple chart tracking how much was recycled.

**Variation 2 - Upcycling Project**: Take items from the "keep using" basket and transform them together. An empty jar becomes a pencil holder, old fabric strips become playdough mats. Emphasize the word "repurpose."

**Repeat play**: Rotate which items go in the baskets to keep the learning fresh. Take it outside and sort natural items: pinecones (compost), plastic found (recycle), rocks (keep using). Visit a local park and practice sorting found items.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to throw everything away or doesn't understand why we don't just get new things.
**Solution**: Use concrete language and mirror the child's experience: "Remember the cup you used yesterday at lunch? We washed it and used it again today. That's how we care for Earth—we use things more than once." Make it a game: "How many times can we use this cup?"

**Challenge**: Child is overwhelmed by too many items or gets frustrated sorting "wrong."
**Solution**: Start with just 3-4 familiar items. There's no wrong answer in exploration; praise effort and curiosity. Gently guide with questions rather than corrections: "I wonder... can this break down like food does?" Keep sessions short and joyful.

**Challenge**: It's hard to explain abstract concepts like "Earth" or "planet" to very young children.
**Solution**: Use the world they know: "This is the ground we play on, the trees we climb, the water we drink. We take care of all of it, just like you take care of your toys."

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Care Practice**: Incorporate one sustainability habit into your routine: reusable cups at meals, cloth napkins instead of paper towels, or water play that's brief. Point out when you're doing it: "Look, we're conserving water!"

2. **Nature Walk**: Collect items outside and sort them, or simply observe plants growing and decomposing leaves returning to soil. Talk about the cycle of nature.

3. **Gift Giving with Purpose**: When the child receives gifts, talk about the box or packaging: "This box is made from trees. Some day it can become a new box." Involve them in reusing or recycling the packaging creatively.
