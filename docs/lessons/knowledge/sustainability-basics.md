# Sustainability Basics

## Activity Summary

Children will explore the concept of caring for our planet through simple, sensory activities that demonstrate how we can reduce waste and protect nature. Through hands-on discovery, they'll learn that our choices matter and that even small actions help take care of Earth.

## Vocabulary

**Decomposition**: The process by which microorganisms — bacteria, fungi, and insects — break down dead organic material into simpler molecules that return to the soil. An apple core decomposes in about 2 months because bacteria can break apart its organic molecules (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen chains). A plastic bottle can take 450 years because its polymer chains are synthetic — bacteria haven't evolved enzymes to break them apart. Decomposition is nature's recycling system: every atom in that apple core will become part of new soil, new plants, new food.

**Carbon cycle**: The continuous movement of carbon atoms through Earth's systems. Plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air during photosynthesis and build it into their leaves and stems. Animals eat the plants and breathe out CO₂. When things decompose, carbon returns to soil and air. Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) releases carbon that was buried underground for millions of years, adding extra CO₂ to the atmosphere faster than plants can absorb it.

**Polymer**: A molecule made of long, repeating chains — like a necklace of identical beads. Plastics are synthetic polymers: humans invented them by linking petroleum molecules into chains that don't exist in nature. That's why bacteria can't decompose most plastics — they have no enzymes for breaking those artificial bonds. Natural polymers like cellulose (wood, paper) and proteins (food) DO decompose because bacteria evolved alongside them for billions of years.

**Greenhouse effect**: When CO₂ and other gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun, like a blanket around the planet. Without any greenhouse effect, Earth would be about -18°C (0°F) — too cold for life. But adding too much CO₂ (from burning fossil fuels) makes the blanket thicker, trapping too much heat. Since 1850, atmospheric CO₂ has risen from about 280 to over 420 parts per million.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: The Itsy Bitsy Spider

**Tempo**: Moderate and caring

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
We can be sustainable
Using things again
Biodegradable things
Return to earth, my friend
We conserve our water
And repurpose what we find
Taking care of planet Earth
We keep it in our mind

*Verse 2*
Reuse the jars and boxes
Give them a new life
Conserve the things we have
Reduce our waste and strife
Sort what's biodegradable
Back to nature's way
Being sustainable
Every single day

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Hug yourself during "taking care of planet Earth"
2. Pretend to sort items into bins during "sort what's biodegradable"
3. Make circular motion with hands for "reuse" and "repurpose"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will sort items into "keep using," "recycle," and "compost" categories while learning about waste reduction. Through this sensory sorting game, they'll discover that many things we use every day can have a second life, and that nature breaks down some materials safely.

**Activity Type**: Sorting activity with sensory exploration

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- 3 baskets, bins, or paper bags labeled with pictures (keep using, recycle, compost)
- 10-15 household items (plastic bottle, glass jar, paper, cardboard box, aluminum foil, apple core, paper towel, plastic bag, wooden spoon, cloth napkin, banana peel, newspaper, plastic cup, egg carton, leaves)
- Pictures or symbols for each category (drawn or printed)

**Optional**:
- Child-safe gardening gloves
- Compost bin or soil
- Labels with words and pictures
- Camera to document sorting

**Cost**: Free (uses household items)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Collect 10-15 safe household items and place them in a central pile or basket
2. Set up 3 baskets or bins in a line, labeled with pictures: green leaf (compost), blue circle (recycle), yellow star (keep using/reuse)
3. Wash all items thoroughly; ensure nothing is sharp or unsafe for handling

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Begin by showing the three baskets and explaining: "Everything is made of molecules — tiny building blocks. Some things are made of natural molecules that bacteria know how to break apart — that's decomposition. Those go here (compost). Some things are made of materials that can be melted down and reshaped — that's recycling (point to recycle). And some things we can just use again and again (keep using)."

   Show one example for each: "This apple core is made of organic molecules — carbon, hydrogen, oxygen. Bacteria in the soil have enzymes that break these chains apart. In two months, these atoms will be part of the soil. But this plastic bottle? It's a polymer — a synthetic chain that bacteria can't break. It would sit in a landfill for 450 years. So we recycle it — melt it and reshape it."

2. **Exploration** (8-10 min):
   Invite the child to pick up one item at a time and decide where it belongs. Ask guiding questions: "Is this something that came from nature and can go back to nature?" "Can this take a nap and become something new?" "Can we use this again?"

   Let them place each item in the basket they choose. Celebrate each choice, even if incorrect—this is about learning, not perfection.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Talk about what you see together. "Look how many things can be recycled! That means less garbage in the ground." Point out items that can be used again: "This cloth napkin can be washed and used at lunch tomorrow!"

   If you have a real compost bin or soil, show what happens to the food waste: "These scraps will mix with soil and help plants grow."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Together, move the "keep using" items back to their homes, put recycling in the bin, and compost items in the appropriate place. Say: "We helped take care of Earth by sorting carefully. Thank you!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Use 5-6 items and two categories: "decomposes" (leaves, food scraps — bacteria can break them down) and "doesn't decompose" (plastic, metal — need recycling or reuse). Use real science language simply: "Banana peel — bacteria can eat this! Plastic cup — bacteria can't eat polymers." Let them sort by feel — organic materials often feel different from synthetic ones.

**3-4+ years**:
Use the full 3-basket system with science explanations for each sort. Introduce the carbon cycle: "This apple took carbon dioxide from the air to grow. When it decomposes, that carbon goes back to the soil and air. It's a cycle!" Discuss polymers: "Plastic is made from petroleum — oil from deep underground. The molecules are chained together in a way bacteria have never seen before." Introduce the greenhouse effect: "When we burn things, CO₂ goes into the atmosphere and traps heat. Too much CO₂ means too much heat." Challenge: "Which items in our house came from fossil fuels? Which came from plants or animals?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Classroom Sorting**: Do this activity daily at snack time or cleanup, having children sort their food waste and packaging. Create a simple chart tracking how much was recycled.

**Variation 2 - Upcycling Project**: Take items from the "keep using" basket and transform them together. An empty jar becomes a pencil holder, old fabric strips become playdough mats. Emphasize the word "repurpose."

**Repeat play**: Rotate which items go in the baskets to keep the learning fresh. Take it outside and sort natural items: pinecones (compost), plastic found (recycle), rocks (keep using). Visit a local park and practice sorting found items.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child wants to throw everything away or doesn't understand why we don't just get new things.
**Solution**: Use concrete language and mirror the child's experience: "Remember the cup you used yesterday at lunch? We washed it and used it again today. That's how we care for Earth—we use things more than once." Make it a game: "How many times can we use this cup?"

**Challenge**: Child is overwhelmed by too many items or gets frustrated sorting "wrong."
**Solution**: Start with just 3-4 familiar items. There's no wrong answer in exploration; praise effort and curiosity. Gently guide with questions rather than corrections: "I wonder... can this break down like food does?" Keep sessions short and joyful.

**Challenge**: It's hard to explain abstract concepts like "Earth" or "planet" to very young children.
**Solution**: Use the world they know: "This is the ground we play on, the trees we climb, the water we drink. We take care of all of it, just like you take care of your toys."

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Daily Care Practice**: Incorporate one sustainability habit into your routine: reusable cups at meals, cloth napkins instead of paper towels, or water play that's brief. Point out when you're doing it: "Look, we're conserving water!"

2. **Nature Walk**: Collect items outside and sort them, or simply observe plants growing and decomposing leaves returning to soil. Talk about the cycle of nature.

3. **Gift Giving with Purpose**: When the child receives gifts, talk about the box or packaging: "This box is made from trees. Some day it can become a new box." Involve them in reusing or recycling the packaging creatively.
