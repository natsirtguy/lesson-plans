# Arts & Culture Activity: Teaching and Tutoring Play

## Activity Summary

Teaching and tutoring play empowers young children to take on the role of teacher or mentor, fostering confidence, communication skills, and understanding of how people learn. Children teach toys or younger children simple concepts, practice patience, experience responsibility, and develop leadership skills through imaginative teaching scenarios. This activity builds self-esteem, strengthens academic language, and helps children understand the teaching-learning process from a new perspective.

**Activity Type**: Dramatic play/Social activity/Cognitive challenge

**Duration**: 20-35 minutes

**Mess Level**: Low to medium - depends on what's being "taught"

**Best Environment**: Quiet space suitable for focused play, or classroom-like setup

## Activity Session Structure

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

**How to introduce and engage**:
- "Today you get to be the teacher! Just like your teacher at school, you'll teach your toys."
- Ask: "What do you like to learn about? Colors? Animals? Songs? You can teach that!"
- Show materials available: "You can use these things to help you teach."
- Explain simply: "Teachers help others learn new things. You get to do that today."

**Setting expectations**:
- "You're going to teach your toy students"
- "Good teachers are patient and kind"
- Success means you taught something and had fun

### Main Activity (15-30 minutes)

**Phase 1: Teacher Preparation** (3-5 minutes)
Child prepares to teach
- Ask: "What will you teach your students?"
- Let them choose the subject and gather materials
- Help them arrange their classroom and students
- Ask: "What will you teach first?"
- Observe how they set up - this shows their understanding of teaching

**Phase 2: Teaching Demonstration** (8-15 minutes)
Child teaches their toy students
- Let them begin in whatever way feels natural
- Observe and comment on their teaching: "You're showing them colors! Good teaching."
- If child is hesitant, ask: "What's your first lesson? Show us."
- Model interest as a "student": "Oh! I learned something!"
- Let them use their own methods - pointing, singing, showing, explaining
- Ask prompts if they get stuck: "What comes next in your lesson?"
- Notice and celebrate teaching behaviors: patience, explanation, repetition

**Phase 3: Expanding the Lesson** (remaining time)
Child develops more complex teaching
- Ask: "Do your students understand? What else do they need to learn?"
- Encourage dialogue: "What would your students ask you?"
- Introduce challenges: "Your student doesn't understand. What can you do?"
- Offer materials: "Would pictures help teach? Songs?"
- Let child end lesson when ready or transition to new topic
- Honor their choice in teaching style and content

**Adult role**:
- Be an engaged observer/interested parent
- Ask genuine questions about what they're teaching
- Model being a good student (listen, try, show interest)
- Offer suggestions if teaching stalls: "Could you show them a song?"
- Help problem-solve: "What would help them learn better?"
- Celebrate their role as teacher
- Don't correct their teaching methods - let them develop their own style

### Wrap-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Concluding the activity**:
- "What a wonderful teacher you are! You taught your students so much."
- Ask: "What did your students learn today? What was your favorite part of teaching?"
- Simple reflection: "How did you feel being a teacher? Was it fun? Was it hard?"
- Celebrate specific teaching moments: "I loved how you showed them that!"

**Transition to cleanup**:
- "Let's help your students clean up their classroom"
- Make cleanup part of lesson: "Teachers help clean up too"
- Store toys and materials together
- End with: "Your classroom is ready for tomorrow's lesson"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Approach**:
- Keep "lessons" very simple and concrete - colors, animals, sounds
- Child may teach more through showing and doing than explaining
- Focus on them holding the teacher role, even if loosely
- Accept non-traditional teaching (may be mostly play-acting)
- Less emphasis on actual content learning

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Adult support**:
- Heavy prompting and modeling of teaching actions
- Very simple teaching content
- Position yourself as enthusiastic student
- Keep structure minimal and flexible
- Join in and help extend the lesson
- Celebrate any moments of directing or teaching

### 3-4+ years

**Extensions**:
- Add more complex lessons - letters, numbers, counting, simple science
- Create teaching materials together before lesson (posters, flashcards)
- Introduce multiple students with different learning needs
- Encourage written elements (letters, numbers on paper)
- Have them explain their teaching: "Why did you teach that first?"
- Add role-play elements: field trip, special guest, homework
- Introduce problem-solving: "That student learns differently. How can you help?"

**Duration**: May sustain 30-40 minutes with complex lesson planning and teaching

## Extension Ideas for Repeat Play

**Variation 1: School Day Simulation**
Create a full school day with multiple subjects, transitions, snack time, recess. Child is teacher managing the full schedule.

**Variation 2: Subject Expert**
Child becomes expert in one topic (animals, colors, music) and teaches multiple lessons about that topic to different toy students.

**Variation 3: Teaching Younger Learner**
If possible, child teaches a younger sibling or peer. Real teaching offers deeper learning about patience and explanation.

**Thematic variations**:
- Music lessons and concerts
- Art class where toys learn to paint
- Sports or dance class
- Cooking or nutrition class
- Science discovery class
- Outdoor nature lessons

## Cultural Context

**Cultural significance**:
Teaching and passing knowledge to the next generation is sacred in cultures worldwide. Across human societies, elders, teachers, and mentors hold honored roles. This activity honors that tradition and helps children understand that teaching is valuable work and that everyone has something to teach.

**Exposure to diversity**:
- Discuss different types of teachers and mentors (music teachers, coaches, elders)
- Show diverse teachers from different cultures and backgrounds
- Talk about how people teach each other in communities
- Discuss different teaching styles around the world
- Include books with diverse teachers and mentors

**Books/Media**:
- "The Mitten" by Jan Brett (can be used as teaching material about stories)
- "Teacher Appreciation Week" concept books
- "Officer Buckle and Gloria" by Peggy Rathmann (learning and teaching safety)
- "Pete the Cat" series (learning through storytelling)

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child struggles to think of what to teach
**Why**: Choosing content is cognitively challenging for young children. They may not see themselves as having knowledge to share.
**Solution**: Offer choices: "You could teach colors, animals, songs, or movements. Which one?" Start with something they know well. Model first: "I'm going to teach my toy animal shapes" then hand it to them.

**Challenge**: Child gets bossy or impatient with toy "students"
**Why**: Managing a classroom is hard! Children are developing patience and understanding that others learn at different paces.
**Solution**: Pause and coach: "Teachers need patience. What can you do when your student doesn't understand yet?" Model patience: "Maybe show them again? Slower?" This is a learning opportunity about empathy.

**Challenge**: Teaching becomes negative or punitive (pretending to hit toys for wrong answers, getting frustrated)
**Why**: Child may be mimicking harsh discipline they've experienced or misunderstanding teaching as correcting
**Solution**: Gently pause and redirect: "In our classroom, we're kind. Let's show them the right way gently." Model kind teaching. If pattern continues, observe whether something else is going on emotionally.

### Tips for Success
- Help them prepare simple "lesson materials" to increase confidence
- Be an engaged, appreciative student - show genuine interest
- Celebrate their teacher role and effort
- Notice and praise patience and kindness
- Let them teach what they know and love
- This activity works especially well if they've recently been in a teaching situation themselves
- Don't worry about accuracy of content - focus on the process of teaching

### What to Do With the Creation
- Photograph their classroom setup to remember
- Let them keep it set up for follow-up lessons
- Save any papers or materials they created
- Ask about it later: "Remember when you taught? What did you teach?"
- Use as conversation starter about their own learning experiences
