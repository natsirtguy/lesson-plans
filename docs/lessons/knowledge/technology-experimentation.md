# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Technology Experimentation

## Activity Summary

Children explore how technology responds to their actions through safe, hands-on interaction with age-appropriate devices and apps. This lesson introduces cause-and-effect relationships, builds digital literacy skills, and develops fine motor control through tapping, swiping, and touching interactive screens and buttons.

## Vocabulary

**Circuit**: A loop that electricity travels through to make things work. Inside every electronic toy, electricity flows from the battery, through tiny wires, to the part that makes light or sound, and back again. When you press a button, you close the circuit — you complete the loop so electricity can flow. When you let go, the loop breaks and the electricity stops.

**Input**: Something you do to a device — pressing a button, tapping a screen, or speaking into a microphone. The device detects your input and responds. Your finger pressing a button is the input; the sound or light that happens is the **output**. Every piece of technology works this way: it takes an input and produces an output.

**Sensor**: A part inside a device that detects something — light, touch, sound, or movement. A touchscreen has sensors under the glass that feel where your finger presses. A toy that plays music when you clap has a sound sensor (a microphone) listening for noise.

**Processor**: The tiny "brain" inside electronic devices that decides what to do when it receives an input. When you press a button on a toy, the signal travels through the circuit to the processor, which decides "play this sound" or "turn on this light." Even simple toys have processors making decisions.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: If You're Happy and You Know It

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
If you want to explore, press a button
If you want to explore, press a button
Technology is fun, interactive for everyone
If you want to explore, press a button

*Verse 2*
Every device has something new to show
Every device has something new to show
We can tap and swipe and play
Explore technology today
Every device has something new to show

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Press finger in the air like pushing a button during "press a button"
2. Swipe hand across during "tap and swipe"
3. Spread arms wide during "something new to show"

## Intro Video Recommendation

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will safely experiment with interactive technology, discovering how tapping, swiping, and pressing produce sounds, lights, and visual changes. Through guided exploration, they'll build cause-and-effect understanding, fine motor skills, and confidence with digital tools while developing healthy technology habits.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on digital exploration with multi-sensory discovery

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Child-safe tablet or electronic learning device (optional but not required)
- Large button remote control or similar device
- Musical or sound-making electronic toy
- Simple cause-and-effect toy (pop-up, light-up, sound-making)
- Safe flashlight or torch

**Optional**:
- Old smartphone or tablet (not currently in use) loaded only with child apps
- Magnifying glass (to examine buttons and details)
- Reflective or light-reactive materials
- Simple wind-up toy (to show non-electric technology)
- Colored tissue paper or cellophane (to explore light)

**Cost**: Free to $20 (if using existing devices)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Test all electronic devices to ensure they work and are safe
2. Check batteries are secure and devices are in good working condition
3. Remove any choking hazards or sharp edges
4. Set up a low table or clear floor space at child's eye level
5. Arrange materials so child can see and reach everything
6. Ensure good lighting so child can see buttons and details clearly

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Show excitement: "Look! I found some really interesting things to explore together today."

   Hold up an electronic toy that makes a sound or light: "This is something special—let's see what happens when we touch it."

   Opening prompt: "What do you think this button does? Want to find out?"

2. **Exploration** (8-12 minutes):

   **Free exploration with minimal guidance:**
   - Child picks up an item and examines it from all angles
   - Adult quietly observes and notes what captures their attention
   - Child presses buttons, pulls levers, or manipulates controls
   - Adult narrates observations without directing: "You found the button! What happened when you pressed it?"
   - Child experiences cause-and-effect naturally (press button → sound/light happens)

   **What to comment on (use real concepts as backdrop):**
   - "You pressed the button and completed the circuit — the electricity flowed through and made a sound!"
   - "The light turned on because your finger touched the sensor under the screen!"
   - "That toy has a tiny processor inside — when you pressed the button, the processor decided to play that sound!"
   - "See how it stops when you let go? You broke the circuit — the electricity can't flow anymore."

3. **Guided Discovery** (3-5 minutes):
   - Demonstrate slowly pressing a button and waiting to see what happens
   - Show how to try buttons one at a time: "Let's try this one... and this one..."
   - Ask open-ended questions: "What do you think will happen if...?"
   - Use a flashlight in a darkened corner: "Watch the light—where does it go?"
   - Introduce comparisons: Hold up a wooden block and device—"Which one makes a sound?"

   **Questions to ask:**
   - "What input did you give it? What output did you get back?"
   - "Can you find the button that completes the circuit to the light?"
   - "What happens if you press this one? What do you think the processor decides to do?"
   - "This one needs batteries. Batteries store electricity — where do you think the electricity goes when you press the button?"

4. **Wrap-Up** (2-3 minutes):
   Signal ending time: "We're going to put these away soon."

   Ask reflection question: "What was your favorite thing you discovered?"

   Celebrate: "You figured out that the button makes it light up!"

   Make cleanup social: "Let's put each thing back where it belongs. Can you put this in the basket?"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Limit to 2-3 items max (can be overwhelming with too many choices)
- Focus on items with big, obvious buttons and immediate responses
- Allow more time for trial-and-error
- Expect brief attention spans (10-15 minutes typical)
- Adult stays very close for safety and modeling
- Emphasize the sensory experience: "That's so loud!", "Look at the bright light!"
- Use narration heavily to name what's happening

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce more complex items (remotes with multiple buttons, devices with different modes)
- Encourage systematic exploration: "Let's try each button and see what happens"
- Ask prediction questions: "What do you think will happen if you press that one?"
- Introduce problem-solving: "How do you turn it back on? Let's figure it out"
- Support longer sequences (button combinations, turning on/off, volume control)
- Introduce real technical language: "circuit," "sensor," "processor," "input," "output," "electricity"
- Encourage discussion about how things work: "The battery stores electricity. When you press the button, the circuit closes and electricity flows to the speaker. The processor tells it which sound to play."
- May engage for 20+ minutes with more complex items

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1—Flashlight Exploration**: Focus entire session on exploring light and dark with a flashlight. Chase shadows, shine through colored tissue paper, explore what lights up different surfaces.

**Variation 2—Sound Discovery**: Dedicate session to sound-making devices only. Explore loud/soft, fast/slow, different types of sounds. Introduce simple rhythm play.

**Variation 3—Button Mapping**: For older toddlers, create a simple chart with pictures of items and see if child can remember which button does what. Return to same items repeatedly to deepen memory.

**Repeat Play**: The same device can be explored multiple times since pressing produces different results depending on where and how you touch it. Rotate between 2-3 favorite items to prevent boredom while building mastery.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child puts device in mouth or tries to eat batteries.

**Solution**: Choose items specifically designed for toddlers with closed batteries. Keep all batteries out of reach. Supervise closely during this activity. Redirect gently: "Let's see what sound it makes instead!"

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated when something doesn't work or battery dies.

**Solution**: Have extra batteries on hand and troubleshoot calmly together. Use language: "It needs a new battery—let's put one in and try again!" Normalize troubleshooting as part of technology use.

**Challenge**: Child wants to use parent's phone or tablet instead of age-appropriate devices.

**Solution**: Have appealing child-safe alternatives ready. Set clear boundaries: "This one is grown-up's. Let's use this one for exploring together." If allowing limited tablet time, use structured apps designed for exploration.

**Challenge**: Child becomes too rough with devices, pressing buttons aggressively.

**Solution**: Model gentle exploration: "Let's try a soft press and see what happens." Praise gentle handling: "Nice gentle touch!" Have durable devices designed for young children. Set expectations early about careful treatment.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Cause-and-Effect at Home**: Explore non-tech cause-and-effect around your home (light switches, wind-up toys, squirt toys). Help them see that many things respond to our actions.

2. **Tech Around the House Tour**: Walk through your home and identify technology: refrigerator, washing machine, microwave, TV, oven. Ask: "How does this technology help us?"

3. **Button Collections**: Explore different buttons and switches around the house (safe ones): doorbell, remote control button (supervised), light switch, toy buttons. Talk about what each one controls.

4. **Create a Tech-Free Time**: Balance exploration days with tech-free days full of nature play, building, and art to develop well-rounded skills.
