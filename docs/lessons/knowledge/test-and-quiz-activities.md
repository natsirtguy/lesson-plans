# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Test and Quiz Activities

## Activity Summary

When you have to *retrieve* a memory — dig it out of your brain on demand — that memory gets stronger. This is called **the testing effect** or **retrieval practice**, one of the most replicated findings in memory science. Simply looking at information again (re-reading, re-watching) does not strengthen memory as much as being asked to recall it. This lesson uses playful quiz games to give children real experience with retrieval practice — asking questions about animals, colors, shapes, people, and concepts from previous lessons — while caregivers introduce the actual science of *why* this works. The quiz is not about catching what they don't know; it's about actively strengthening what they do know.

## Vocabulary

**Retrieval**: Pulling a memory out of your brain when you need it — like reaching into a backpack to find something. Every time you retrieve a memory, your brain makes a stronger path to it for next time.

**Testing effect**: The scientific discovery that being *tested* on something (having to recall it) makes you remember it better than just reviewing it. Your brain gets stronger at remembering things it has had to work to find.

**Multiple choice**: A type of question that gives you several options to choose from, so you can recognize the right answer even if you can't recall it on your own. Recognition is easier than pure recall.

**Recall**: Remembering something without being given clues or options — searching for the memory purely from inside your mind. Harder than recognition, but also makes memories stronger.

**Spaced repetition**: Practicing the same information on different days, spread out over time, rather than all at once. Memory science shows that spreading practice out makes memories last much longer.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: If You're Happy and You Know It

**Tempo**: Upbeat and encouraging

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
When I answer questions, I discover what I know
When I answer questions, I discover what I know
Every challenge makes me smart
Questions are a special art
When I answer questions, I discover what I know

*Verse 2*
If you know the answer, shout it out
If you know the answer, shout it out
Questions help us learn and grow
Discover all the things we know
If you know the answer, shout it out

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Point to your head during "discover what I know"
2. Give thumbs up during "answer"
3. Shout and raise hands during "shout it out"

## Intro Video Recommendation

**Recommended video**: Search YouTube for "simple quiz games for preschoolers" or "educational question games toddlers"

**What to look for**:
- 2-5 minutes long
- Adult asking simple, silly questions with visual props
- Positive celebration of answers (not focusing on right/wrong)
- Bright, engaging visuals
- Examples of yes/no questions, "I spy" games, or picture identification
- Focuses on fun and confidence-building rather than testing

**Alternative searches** (if specific video not found):
- "Toddler learning games with questions"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children participate in simple, playful quiz games where they retrieve information about animals, colors, shapes, and concepts they've encountered before. The key idea to introduce: **every time your brain has to search for a memory and find it, that memory gets stronger**. Caregivers should name this explicitly during the activity — not as praise ("you're so smart!") but as science ("your brain just did retrieval practice — you made that memory stronger"). The goal is to build children's understanding of *how their own minds work*, alongside the content of the questions themselves.

**Activity Type**: Interactive question game / Discovery play

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

**Setup time**: 5 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards (can be printed images, photos from magazines, or drawn by you)
- Familiar objects from around the house (toy animals, household items, food items)
- Large paper or poster board (optional, for visual answer choices)

**Optional**:
- Whiteboard or paper for drawing clues
- Small reward items (stickers, stamps, or tokens for positive reinforcement)
- Dice for selecting which question to answer
- Costume props (hat, glasses) to wear as the "quiz master"

**Cost**: Free (using household items and printed pictures) or Under $5 (if purchasing picture card sets)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather 8-12 picture cards showing familiar objects, animals, and people the child knows (you can print from the internet, cut from magazines, or draw simple pictures)
2. Arrange cards face-up on a table or floor where the child can see them clearly
3. Have a few actual objects available (stuffed animal, toy car, real fruit, etc.)
4. Test your questions beforehand to ensure they're age-appropriate and match the child's current knowledge level

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Introduce the activity with the actual science: "Today we're playing a question game — and I want to tell you something cool about it. Scientists have discovered that when your brain has to *search* for an answer and find it, that memory gets stronger. It's called the testing effect. So every question you answer today is actually making your memory better!"

   Sing a verse of the learning song to set the tone, then begin.

2. **Simple Yes/No Questions** (3-4 minutes):
   Start with the easiest format. Hold up picture cards or objects one at a time and ask simple yes/no questions:
   - "Is this a dog?" (show picture of dog)
   - "Do cats meow?" (yes/no)
   - "Is this banana yellow?" (yes/no)
   - "Can birds fly?" (yes/no)

   Celebrate every answer with enthusiasm: "Yes! You know that!" or "That's right, great thinking!"

3. **Multiple Choice Questions** (4-6 minutes):
   Increase complexity slightly with multiple-choice format. Show the child options:
   - "Is this a cat, a dog, or a bird?" (point to picture)
   - "What color is this? Red or blue?"
   - "Does a cow say 'meow' or 'moo'?"
   - "Which one is soft? The rock or the pillow?"

   Let the child respond however they're comfortable — pointing, saying the word, or showing the picture. Name the format: "This is called multiple choice — I'm giving you options to choose from. That's a different kind of remembering than when I give you no clues at all. Which do you think is harder?"

4. **Picture Matching Game** (2-3 minutes):
   Optional additional round: Lay out picture cards and ask "Can you find the apple?" or "Where is the dog?" Let the child point to or pick up the correct picture.

5. **Wrap-up** (1-2 minutes):
   Reflect on what happened in their brain: "Every time your brain searched for an answer today, it made that memory stronger. That's retrieval practice — it's what scientists say is one of the best ways to really remember something."

   Optional: Give a sticker or high-five, but connect it to the science rather than performance: "This sticker is for doing retrieval practice!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use only 4-6 picture cards with very familiar items (ball, dog, cat, apple, car)
- Stick primarily to yes/no questions
- Accept all forms of communication as answers (pointing, sounds, words, nods)
- Keep it very short (5-8 minutes)
- Provide the answer within the question: "Is this a dog? Yes, it's a dog!" to model the correct response
- Use real objects the child can touch and explore, not just pictures
- Don't correct—celebrate all attempts: "You're thinking about it, great job!"

**3-4+ years**:
- Use 10-15 picture cards with mix of familiar and newer items
- Include all three question types: yes/no, multiple choice, and open-ended ("What's this?" "Tell me about this picture")
- Introduce silly wrong answers: "Is this a dog? Is it a purple elephant? Is it a cat?" (children love identifying the silly one)
- Extend to 12-15 minutes with breaks between rounds
- Ask follow-up questions: "How do you know that?" or "What else can you tell me about dogs?"
- Keep score in a playful way (stickers on paper, blocks in a tower) to add a game element
- Introduce "I Spy" style clues: "I'm thinking of an animal that says 'moo'—what is it?"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Scavenger Hunt Quiz**: Hide picture cards around the house and ask the child to find them based on yes/no clues: "I'm looking for something that's red. Can you find it?" This combines movement with the quiz activity.

**Variation 2 - Sensory Quiz**: Use objects the child can touch, smell, or listen to without seeing them first. Ask "What do you think this is?" based on touch or sound alone (crinkly paper, smooth marble, bell that rings), then reveal the object. Great for building vocabulary around textures and sounds.

**Variation 3 - Story Quiz**: Read a simple story or watch a short video together, then ask questions about it afterward: "What color was the cat?" "Who was hungry?" "What did they eat?" This connects quizzing to comprehension and memory.

**Repeat play**: Each week, introduce 3-4 new picture cards to keep the game fresh. Change the theme (one day focus on animals, another day on colors and shapes, another day on foods). Invite family members to take turns being the question-asker. Let the child make the picture cards one day and ask you the questions—this reversal builds confidence and understanding.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't answer or gives incorrect answers, and you're unsure whether to correct them.

**Solution**: At this age, never focus on right/wrong. Instead, frame it as discovery. If they answer incorrectly, gently provide the information without judgment: "Great thinking! That's a cat. This one here is a dog. Dogs say 'woof!'" Then move on. The goal is building confidence in attempting answers, not perfect accuracy. Over multiple sessions, their accuracy will naturally improve as vocabulary and memory develop.

**Challenge**: Child loses interest or gets frustrated after a few questions.

**Solution**: This activity should always feel like play, never like a test. If engagement drops, stop immediately. Never pressure a child to answer. Keep sessions very short (5-8 minutes for 2-3 year olds, up to 15 for 3-4 year olds). If a child seems frustrated, switch to a different activity or take a break. You can return to quizzing later when they're in a more playful mood.

**Challenge**: Child memorizes answers but doesn't seem to really understand the concepts.

**Solution**: This is completely normal. Young children learn through repetition. When a child repeats an answer they've heard before, they're still learning. To deepen understanding, add follow-up experiences: "Yes, a dog says 'woof!' Let's go find a picture of a dog together" or "You're right, the apple is red. Let's find other red things in the house." Direct experience strengthens conceptual understanding beyond just answer recall.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Vocabulary Building from Answers**: When the child answers a question, expand their learning with immediate follow-up. If they identify a dog, spend 2-3 minutes exploring dogs further: look at books about dogs, watch a short dog video, or talk about dogs you know. This connects the quiz moment to deeper learning.

2. **Create Question Cards Together**: As a follow-up activity, let the child help you draw or select pictures for new question cards. Discuss what questions you could ask about each picture. This reverses the roles and builds their understanding of how questions work.

3. **Daily Integration**: Naturally integrate question-asking into daily routines without calling it a "quiz." While getting dressed: "What color shirt should we wear today?" At lunch: "What food are you eating?" At bedtime: "What was your favorite part of today?" This makes questioning a natural part of conversation, not a special activity.
