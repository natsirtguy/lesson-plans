# KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION: Understanding Others' Feelings (Empathy)

## Activity Summary

Children develop empathy by learning to recognize, name, and respond to the feelings of others. Through story-based activities, emotion mirroring games, and guided observation, children discover that other people have feelings just like they do and that they can help make someone feel better. This foundation for empathy builds social awareness and strengthens relationships.

## Vocabulary

Select 3-4 vocabulary words that are sophisticated but age-appropriate and directly relate to understanding others' emotions.

**Empathy**: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. When your friend is sad and you give them a hug to make them feel better, you're showing empathy. It's like imagining how someone else feels inside.

**Compassion**: Caring about someone when they're having a hard time and wanting to help them feel better. When a child falls down and you sit with them and offer comfort, you're showing compassion by caring about their hurt.

**Recognize**: To notice and identify something, like noticing when someone is sad by seeing their sad face or hearing their sad voice. We recognize feelings by looking at facial expressions, listening to tone of voice, and watching body language.

**Comfort**: To help someone feel better when they're upset, sad, or scared. You can comfort someone with a hug, a kind word, sitting nearby, or bringing them a favorite toy.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

**Tempo**: Slow and gentle

**Lyrics** (2 verses, 4-6 lines each):

*Verse 1*
When my friend is sad and cries
I can see it in their eyes
I will sit right by their side
Help them feel so safe inside
When I see they need some care
I can show that I'm right there

*Verse 2*
When my friend is happy too
I can smile the way they do
All their feelings help me grow
Care for others, let them know
Understanding how they feel
Makes our friendship oh so real

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Place hand on heart when singing about recognizing feelings, showing you're thinking about emotions
2. Reach out arms toward a friend on "sit right by their side," mimicking the action of being there for someone
3. Mirror the expression (sad face, then happy face) when singing about different feelings to demonstrate recognizing emotions

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children develop empathy through emotional detective work and hands-on comforting strategies. They'll learn to identify emotions in others through facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice, then practice genuine ways to offer comfort. This interactive activity moves beyond naming feelings to taking action—the true foundation of empathy.

**Activity Type**: Sensory exploration combined with role-play and guided observation

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Picture cards or photos showing faces with different emotions (happy, sad, scared, angry) - can be printed, drawn, or use actual photos
- One comfort item per child (soft blanket, stuffed animal, or pillow)
- A doll, puppet, or stuffed animal to use as "the character who needs help"
- Mirror (small hand mirror or reflective surface)

**Optional**:
- Emotion picture book (The Feelings Book, Today I Feel Silly, or similar)
- Audio clips with different tones of voice (happy voice, sad voice, etc.)
- Props for role-play (bandage for pretend "ouchie," blanket for "I'm cold")

**Cost**: Free (using items from home) to Under $5

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Gather emotion picture cards or draw simple faces showing different feelings on paper plates or index cards
2. Seat yourself and child(ren) at a low table or on the floor where everyone can see clearly
3. Have the doll/puppet and comfort items accessible and visible
4. Safety check: Ensure mirror is unbreakable; clear area of tripping hazards

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Introduce a situation with the doll: "Oh, my friend Teddy had a sad thing happen. Let's help figure out what Teddy is feeling." Show the doll with a sad expression. Ask: "Can you look at Teddy's face? What do you think Teddy feels right now?" Point out physical cues: "See Teddy's mouth? It's turned down. That tells us Teddy might feel sad."

2. **Exploration** (5-10 min):
   **Emotion Recognition Phase**: Spread out emotion picture cards. Show one card at a time and ask: "Does this face look happy or sad?" or "What feeling do you see here?" Point out details: eyes, mouth, eyebrows. Encourage the child to copy the facial expression in the mirror: "Can you make a sad face like this? Look in the mirror. Do your eyes and mouth look the same?" Repeat with 3-4 different emotions.

   **Tone of Voice Phase**: Speak the same word (like "hello") in different tones—happy voice, sad voice, angry voice, scared voice. Ask: "Does my voice sound happy or sad now?" Help the child hear the difference in tone even with the same words.

   **Body Language Observation**: Point to a picture card and ask: "When someone feels this way, what does their body do?" (Sad person might hunch shoulders, happy person might jump, scared person might hug themselves). Have the child physically show you these body positions.

3. **Discovery** (3-5 min):
   Return to the doll scenario: "Teddy is sad right now. What can we do to help Teddy feel better?" Generate comfort ideas together: "We could give Teddy a hug. We could sit next to Teddy. We could say kind words." Demonstrate each one with the doll. Ask the child: "Which one do you think Teddy would like?" Let the child choose and perform the comfort action with the doll. Affirm: "You showed compassion! You made Teddy feel better."

   Real-world connection: "Have you ever felt sad? What helped YOU feel better?" Share a personal example: "When I feel sad, my friend sits with me and that helps. You can do that for others too."

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Sing the verse of the learning song together while gently hugging the doll or comfort item. Recap: "Today we learned how to see when someone has a feeling, and how we can help them feel better. That's called empathy—understanding and caring about other people's feelings." Offer the child their own comfort item as a calming transition.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus on just TWO emotions: happy and sad (not anger, fear, or more complex feelings)
- Use real photos or actual facial expressions of familiar people (parent, caregiver) rather than abstract pictures
- Keep tone of voice demonstration very exaggerated (big happy voice vs. very quiet sad voice)
- Shorten exploration phase to 3-5 minutes total
- Emphasize physical comfort actions (hugs, sitting together) rather than verbal comfort
- Use only one doll/puppet to avoid overstimulation
- Repeat the same scenario 2-3 times rather than switching activities

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce 4-5 emotions: happy, sad, angry, scared, silly/excited
- Use emotion picture cards and discuss WHY someone might feel that way ("What happened that made them sad?")
- Explore body language in more detail: "How does a scared person stand? How does an angry person move?"
- Practice multiple comfort strategies and discuss which works best for different emotions
- Introduce the idea that the same situation makes different people feel different ways
- Create a simple "comfort kit" of strategies to use when friends are upset
- Encourage the child to recall times when THEY felt different emotions and discuss what helped

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1 - Emotion Story Creation**: Read a simple story and pause at emotional moments to ask: "How does the character feel now? What should we do to help?" Create endings where the child suggests helpful actions.

**Variation 2 - Emotion Scavenger Hunt**: Hide small toys or pictures around a room and ask the child to find items that represent different feelings. ("Find something that makes you feel happy." "Find something that feels soft and comforting.")

**Variation 3 - Comfort Chest**: Create a special box or basket filled with items that help when feelings are big (soft blanket, calm music, fidget toy, picture of loved ones). Let the child decorate the box and choose items to put inside.

**Repeat play**:
- Change the emotion the doll is experiencing each session
- Use different dolls or stuffed animals as the character needing help
- Gradually introduce more complex scenarios (two friends having different feelings, conflicting needs)
- Invite the child to BE the doll sometimes, while the caregiver shows empathy—reversing roles helps deep understanding

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child shows no emotional response to another person's distress; seems unaware when someone is crying or upset
**Solution**: This is developmentally normal at ages 2-3. Explicitly name what you observe without judgment: "I see tears coming down Sam's face. Sam feels sad." Model empathetic response yourself first: "Sam is sad. I'm going to sit with Sam and give a hug." Your demonstration of empathy is how young children learn. Gradually invite participation: "Let's go see if Sam wants a hug too." Never force the child to comfort others, but keep naming and modeling.

**Challenge**: Child shows aggressive or dismissive responses when others are upset (laughs, pushes away, or walks away)
**Solution**: Stay calm and curious rather than punitive. This often indicates the child is overwhelmed by the emotional intensity. Help them understand the feeling: "When Sam cries loudly, that's a big feeling. It can feel like a lot." Offer a calm alternative: "Would you like to sit far away and watch, or would you like to hold my hand while we stay with Sam?" Let the child engage at their comfort level. Aggression toward crying often decreases when the child feels safe.

**Challenge**: Child is overly emotional or takes on others' feelings too intensely; becomes upset when peers are upset
**Solution**: This child may have strong emerging empathy but lacks emotional regulation. Validate: "You notice when your friend feels sad, and you care. That's wonderful." Teach grounding: "You can help your friend feel better, and YOU are safe. Feel my hand. I'm here with you." Differentiate: "Your feeling and your friend's feeling are separate. You can help without taking on their sadness." Teach simple comfort strategies your child CAN do, which gives agency and reduces overwhelm.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Real-World Recognition Practice**: Throughout your day, pause and name emotions you observe: "Look, that child on the playground is laughing—they're having fun!" "The baby looks tired and fussy." "I see your friend wants a turn with that toy. They might feel frustrated." This continuous narration builds the habit of emotional awareness.

2. **Family Feelings Conversation**: At meals or bedtime, ask each family member: "What feeling did you have today?" or "When did someone show you they cared about you?" This normalizes discussing emotions and models that empathy is a family value.

3. **Help When It Matters**: Create real opportunities for the child to help comfort someone: "Your sibling looks sad. Would you like to bring them a toy or a hug?" "Grandpa looks tired. You could sit with him." Real empathy practice is far more powerful than any activity.
