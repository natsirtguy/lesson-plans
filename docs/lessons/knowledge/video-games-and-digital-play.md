# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Video Games and Digital Play

## Activity Summary

This lesson introduces young children to age-appropriate digital play, developing fine motor skills and interactive decision-making in a supervised, balanced environment. Children will explore touchscreens or simple controllers, practice turn-taking with games, and learn how digital play can be both fun and educational when managed thoughtfully.

## Vocabulary

**Interface**: The buttons, screens, and controls you use to interact with a game—like the touchscreen on a tablet or the buttons on a controller that let your fingers tell the game what to do.

**Navigate**: To move around and find your way through a game world or app by tapping, swiping, or pressing buttons to guide a character or make choices.

**Interact**: To engage with something and watch it respond to your actions—when you tap a picture or push a button, the game reacts with sounds, movement, or changes on the screen.

**Respond**: When something answers back or reacts to what you do—when you tap a game, it responds by making sounds or showing new pictures.

## Activity

### Activity Overview

Children will engage in supervised digital play on a tablet or touchscreen device, practicing fine motor control, turn-taking, and responding to interactive content. This activity emphasizes balanced screen time with social interaction and transitions to hands-on play.

**Activity Type**: Interactive digital exploration with social interaction

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

**Setup time**: Minimal (5 minutes to prepare device and select app)

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Tablet, iPad, or smartphone with touchscreen (or computer with mouse)
- Age-appropriate app or game (see recommendations below)
- Clean screen and/or screen protector
- Comfortable seating or lap position for adult and child

**Optional**:
- Game controller (for older children)
- Tablet stand or holder (reduces strain)
- Timer (visual timer helps children understand when screen time ends)
- Follow-up craft materials for transition activity

**Recommended Apps** (free or low-cost, age-appropriate):
- Toca Boca series (Toca Kitchen, Toca Builders, Peek-a-Boo Zoo)
- Duck Duck Moose games (Hairy Letters, Storyland)
- PBS Kids apps
- Sago Mini World
- Toca Hair Salon
- Fingerpaint Studio

**Cost**: Free to $10 (many quality apps are free or under $5)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Download and test the app beforehand to ensure it's appropriate and functioning smoothly
2. Clean the screen to prevent smudges and ensure good visibility
3. Place the device in an accessible position for the child—at eye level, not too close (18+ inches away)
4. Set a visual timer for the activity (use app timer or physical sand timer)
5. Have a transition activity ready (coloring, blocks, outdoor play) for after screen time

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (1-2 min):
   - Sit together and show the child the app briefly
   - Name what you see: "Look, there's a duck! We can tap the duck"
   - Model tapping gently once or twice
   - Say: "Your turn—you try tapping the duck. What happens?"

2. **Exploration** (7-10 min):
   - Let the child lead exploration with your guidance
   - Use language to describe their actions: "You're swiping! The colors are changing"
   - Ask simple questions: "Can you tap the blue one?" or "What sound does that make?"
   - Model turn-taking: "I'll tap this one, now you tap"
   - Praise gentle tapping: "Nice gentle taps—you're controlling the game"
   - Watch for signs of frustration; switch apps if needed
   - Sit close and narrate what's happening to deepen engagement

3. **Discovery** (1-2 min):
   - Pause briefly and point out cause-and-effect: "When you tapped, it made a sound!"
   - Ask: "What's your favorite part?"
   - Notice whether child prefers tapping, swiping, or longer-press interactions
   - Comment on colors, characters, or sounds they're interacting with

4. **Wrap-up** (1-2 min):
   - Use the timer to give warning: "Two more taps, then we're finished"
   - Close the app together while narrating: "We're putting the game away"
   - Immediately offer a transition activity: "Now let's paint/play with blocks/go outside"
   - Praise their gentle hands and turn-taking: "You did such a good job taking turns!"

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Use very simple apps with immediate, obvious responses (tap = sound/movement)
- Keep sessions to 5-10 minutes maximum
- Focus on single-interaction games (tap something, one thing happens)
- Let adult's hands guide or demonstrate first
- Choose apps without complex navigation (no menus, buttons on edges, etc.)
- Expect shorter attention span—have multiple apps ready to switch between
- Avoid games that require fine precision (better: large tap targets)

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce apps with slightly more complexity (multi-step sequences)
- Extend sessions to 10-15 minutes
- Encourage turn-taking: "Now I'll do one, then you do one"
- Challenge with simple choices: "Do you want to tap the red or yellow?"
- Introduce simple controller use (if available) to develop button control
- Ask open-ended questions: "What do you think will happen if you tap that?"
- Begin discussing screen time limits in child-friendly language: "Games are fun when we play for a little while, then do other things"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1—Digital storytelling**: Use apps like "Storyland" or "Toca Builders" where children create their own sequences; narrate their creations out loud together.

**Variation 2—Mixed media**: After 10 minutes of digital play, transition to a related hands-on activity (e.g., after Toca Kitchen, do real cooking or play kitchen; after Peek-a-Boo Zoo, look at animal books or toy animals).

**Variation 3—Controller practice**: For 3-4+ year olds, try simple console games with kid-friendly controllers (Nintendo Switch games like "Just Dance" or "Mario Kart" with assistance) to develop larger motor control.

**Repeat play**: Rotate between 3-4 different apps to maintain novelty; revisit favorites but mix in new discoveries; notice which games hold attention longest and which frustrate the child.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Screen Time Balance

For ages 2-4, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends:
- Under 18 months: Avoid screen media (except high-quality video chatting)
- 18-24 months: Only high-quality programming, co-viewed with parents
- 2-5 years: Limit to 1 hour per day of quality content, always with parent guidance

This activity is designed as an occasional, supervised experience—not a daily replacement for physical play, outdoor time, or hands-on learning.

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes frustrated when taps don't work or game doesn't respond as expected.
**Solution**: Some apps have unresponsive areas. Gently guide the child to "tap the buttons on the bottom" or show them by pointing. If frustration continues, switch to a different, simpler app. Frustration is normal—remain calm and model moving on without shame.

**Challenge**: Child grabs the screen too hard or taps frantically, or won't give the device back.
**Solution**: Before starting, demonstrate "gentle taps" on your own hand. If they tap hard, say: "Easy taps—like gentle rain, not stomping." Use a visual timer and establish the routine: "When the timer goes beep, we close the game." Stay consistent. Transitions are hardest; have something immediately engaging ready (snack, toy, outdoor activity).

**Challenge**: Child asks to play constantly or seems addicted to one app.
**Solution**: Digital play is engaging by design. This is developmentally normal. Set clear, consistent boundaries: "Games are for Tuesday and Friday afternoons, for 10 minutes." Stick to it. Offer rich alternatives (sensory play, music, building) to balance the attraction of screens. If excessive screen time seems to affect sleep, mood, or engagement with other activities, reduce duration or frequency.

**Challenge**: Child's hands are too small for precise tapping or they keep missing targets.
**Solution**: Choose apps with larger tap areas and immediate feedback. For younger 2-year-olds, touchscreen apps are often easier than controller-based games. Use a stylus or your own hand to help them tap at first (hand-over-hand guidance). No pressure for precision—the goal is exploration and cause-and-effect, not performance.

### Follow-Up Activities
1. **Transition craft**: Use a visual timer and transition immediately to a hands-on activity (coloring, blocks, sensory bin) to shift engagement away from screens
2. **Talk about what they played**: Extend learning by discussing the app—"Remember the duck? What color was it?"—connecting digital and physical learning
3. **Find it in real life**: If they played with animal apps, look for toy animals or animal books; if they played with cooking games, do real cooking or play kitchen
