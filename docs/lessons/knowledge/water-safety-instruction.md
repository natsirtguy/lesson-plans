# 📚 KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Water Safety

## 🎯 Activity Summary

Water safety instruction teaches young children essential awareness and protective practices through interactive demonstrations, songs, and guided water play. Children learn to respect water, recognize safe behaviors, and develop water awareness that builds confidence while protecting them in and around water environments.

## Vocabulary

**Supervise**: To watch carefully and protect someone, keeping them safe from harm. When you're playing near water, a trusted grown-up supervises you by staying right beside you and paying close attention.

**Immerse**: To put something or someone completely into liquid. We don't immerse your whole face in water when you're learning water safety—we go slowly and keep water away from your nose and mouth.

**Density**: How much "stuff" (mass) is packed into a space. Objects that are less dense than water float; objects that are more dense than water sink. A rubber duck floats because rubber and the trapped air inside are together less dense than water. A stone sinks because it's much more dense. This is why a hollow metal boat floats — its overall density (metal plus all the air inside) is less than water.

**Buoyant**: Able to float because of being less dense than water. When an object is buoyant, the water pushes up on it with a force strong enough to hold it up. A scientist named Archimedes discovered that the upward force from water equals the weight of the water the object pushes aside — so a big floating object pushes aside a lot of water, and that water pushes back just as hard.

**Surface tension**: A property of water where the surface acts like a thin, stretchy film. Surface tension exists because water molecules are attracted to each other — they pull together at the surface, creating a kind of skin. This is why water bugs can walk on water and why a careful drop of water holds its round shape.

**Submerged**: Covered completely by water or liquid. When something is fully submerged, water pressure pushes on it from all sides — and objects that can't breathe air (like people and animals) are in danger when submerged because our lungs need air, not water, to get oxygen into our blood.

## 🎵 Learning Song

**Tune**: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

**Tempo**: Upbeat and playful

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*

Old MacDonald stayed near water, E-I-E-I-O
And he sat down very slowly, E-I-E-I-O
With a sit-sit here and a sit-sit there
Here a sit, there a sit, everywhere a safe-sit
Old MacDonald stayed near water, E-I-E-I-O

*Verse 2*

Old MacDonald told a grown-up, E-I-E-I-O
Before he played with splashing water, E-I-E-I-O
With a tell-tell here and a tell-tell there
Here a tell, there a tell, everywhere we tell-tell
Old MacDonald told a grown-up, E-I-E-I-O

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Slow sitting motion (crouch and sit gently) while singing "sit-sit"
2. Point to a trusted adult while singing "tell-tell"
3. Make gentle splashing motions with hand while singing "splashing water"

## Activity

### Activity Overview

In this guided experience, children explore water safely while learning key water safety rules through demonstration, practice, and play. They'll discover what water feels like, observe floating objects, and practice safe behaviors like sitting down and asking a trusted adult for permission.

**Activity Type**: Hands-on demonstration / Sensory exploration / Safety practice

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (with natural breaks for comfort)

**Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

### Materials Needed

**Essential**:
- Shallow water (sink, bowl, kiddie pool, or water table)
- 2-3 child-safe water containers
- Soft towels or washcloths for drying
- Floatable toys (bath toys, rubber ducks, toy boats)
- Dry clothes (backup outfit)

**Optional**:
- Water safety picture cards
- Toy rescue equipment (toy life rings, floatie animals)
- Colored water or bubbles for sensory engagement
- Waterproof children's book about water safety
- Duck or floating toy animals for imaginative play

**Cost**: Free (uses household items and water access)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:
1. Fill water container to safe depth (very shallow for 2-3 year-olds)
2. Clear the area around water of hazards and slipping risks
3. Arrange towels and dry clothes within easy reach
4. Test water temperature—it should be comfortably cool or warm, never hot
5. Gather all materials and place within arm's reach

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes):
   Sit beside the water and create excitement: "Look at this water! It's cool and we're going to explore it safely together." Point out the water, let the child look and observe. Ask simple questions: "What do you see? Do you see it moving?" Sing the opening of your water safety song to establish a positive, playful mood.

2. **Exploration** (8-12 minutes):
   Guide the child's hands into the water gently. Say: "Feel the water. It's cool and smooth." Let the child explore:
   - Pouring water slowly from containers
   - Watching toys float on the surface
   - Making gentle splashes (not on faces)
   - Observing how water moves and flows

   Narrate with the physics: "Your toy floats on top! That means it's less dense than water — there's a lot of air trapped inside. Let's try this stone — it's very dense, much heavier than the same amount of water, so it sinks right away." Test multiple objects: a cork, a spoon, a sponge, a small rock. Ask: "Why does this one float and that one sink?" Introduce the idea: "Archimedes figured out that the water is actually pushing UP on things — that pushing force is called buoyancy!"

3. **Safety Practice** (5-8 minutes):
   Practice safe behaviors through play:
   - Practice "Safe Sitting": Child sits properly while you praise: "Yes! You're sitting safely in the water!"
   - Play "Gentle Hands": Make soft splashes while you narrate "nice and easy"
   - Toy Rescue Game: A toy floats and the child helps while you guide: "Let's help your toy stay safe"
   - Repeat safety rules together: "We sit down in water. We ask a grown-up first!"

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes):
   Drain the water or move away from it. Celebrate specific safe behaviors: "You sat safely! You told me what you wanted to do!" Sing a goodbye song: "Water, water, time to go / We played safely, now we know!" Praise the child and move to drying off. Help the child dry hands while discussing one fun thing they learned.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
Keep water time very brief (5-8 minutes of active play). Focus on simple, concrete rules: sit down, stay close, no solo water. Use lots of repetition and demonstration. Expect to provide constant physical guidance throughout—sit right beside the child, guide hand movements, and narrate continuously. Build comfort gradually; some children need multiple sessions.

**3-4+ years**:
Extend exploration time to 10-15 minutes. Introduce more complex scenarios: "What if we drop a toy? Do we jump in or ask for help?" Add water rescue concepts and response skills: "If water goes in your nose, we stop and tell an adult." Connect water play to other learning: count floating toys, sort by color, describe textures. Tell short stories about characters learning water safety. Encourage more independence while maintaining close supervision.

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1**: Water Safety Stories - Tell stories using action figures or toys to demonstrate safe scenarios (asking permission, sitting down, staying with a buddy).

**Variation 2**: Water Safety Role-Play - Use puppets or stuffed animals to show both unsafe and safe water behaviors. Ask the child: "Is that safe or unsafe?"

**Variation 3**: Different Water Environments - Explore water safety in different contexts: bathtub water safety, puddle safety on rainy days, sprinkler safety, or beach water safety (for older children).

**Repeat play**: Vary the toys, use different water containers, add floating objects to discover (corks, sponges, foam), or create simple water games to keep the activity fresh across multiple sessions.

## 📝 Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is fearful of water or resists getting near it
**Solution**: Go very slowly. Start with just looking at water, then touching the edge, then putting hands in. Never force. Use songs and positive language. Model comfort and safety yourself. Some children need weeks to build comfort—that's developmentally normal and okay.

**Challenge**: Child tries to drink the water or put water in mouth
**Solution**: Gently redirect: "Water is for washing and playing, not for drinking." Keep a separate cup of drinking water nearby. Use calm, consistent redirection. This is normal exploration that improves with repetition and age.

**Challenge**: Child gets water in face and panics
**Solution**: Warn before any water splashing. Have a soft towel ready. Use a warm, calm voice: "A little water on your face is okay—it washes right off." Let the child practice at their own pace with your support.

**Challenge**: Child runs toward water or tries to go in alone
**Solution**: Constant supervision is essential. Create physical boundaries (keep child between you and water). Teach "Wait for me!" as a safety routine. Practice stopping at "the water line" as a game. Never leave the child alone with water.

**Challenge**: Child refuses to follow safety rules
**Solution**: Stay consistent with clear, simple rules. Use calm redirection, not punishment. Offer choices within safe limits: "Do you want the red cup or blue cup?" Celebrate rule-following immediately with praise.

### Follow-Up Activities
1. **Reinforce at home**: Practice water safety rules during bath time, handwashing, and daily routines
2. **Expand learning**: Explore water in different settings (puddles, sprinklers, fountains) with the same safety principles
3. **Build confidence**: Regular, positive water exposure helps children develop comfort and respect for water over time
