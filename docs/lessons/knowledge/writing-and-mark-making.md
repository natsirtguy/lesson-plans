# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Writing and Mark Making

## Activity Summary

Children explore the joy of making visible marks and early writing through painting, drawing, crayoning, and scribbling on various surfaces. This foundational experience builds fine motor control, hand-eye coordination, and self-expression while introducing the concept that marks and symbols can communicate ideas and feelings.

## Vocabulary

**Motor cortex**: The strip of brain along the top of your head that controls every movement your body makes. Your motor cortex has a disproportionately large area dedicated to your hands — 34 separate muscles in each hand, controlled by thousands of motor neurons. Writing is one of the most complex motor tasks humans perform, requiring precise coordination of finger flexors, extensors, and the tiny intrinsic muscles of the hand.

**Grapheme**: A written symbol that represents a sound or meaning — every letter, number, and character you write is a grapheme. The letter "A" evolved from a Phoenician symbol for an ox head (aleph, ~1050 BCE), which was turned upside down by the Greeks. Writing itself was invented only about 5,400 years ago in Mesopotamia — making it one of the newest human inventions.

**Pigment**: The material in crayons, markers, and paint that gives them color. Pigments work by absorbing certain wavelengths of light and reflecting others — a red crayon absorbs all colors except red wavelengths, which bounce back to your eyes. Crayon pigment is suspended in paraffin wax; marker pigment is dissolved in liquid ink; pencil "lead" is actually graphite (carbon) mixed with clay.

**Myelination**: The process where nerve fibers in the brain and hands get wrapped in a fatty insulating layer called myelin, which makes electrical signals travel up to 100 times faster. This is why fine motor skills improve with practice — each repetition strengthens the myelin sheath around the neural pathways for that movement. Children's hand motor pathways are still actively myelinating, which is why writing develops gradually from large scribbles to precise letters.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Mary Had a Little Lamb

**Tempo**: Moderate and cheerful

**Lyrics** (2 verses, with actions):

*Verse 1*
Make some marks upon the page, on the page, on the page,
Make some marks upon the page, scribble all you like!
Trace the lines and draw a loop, draw a loop, draw a loop,
Trace the lines and draw a loop, expression feels so right!

*Verse 2*
Red and blue and green marks too, green marks too, green marks too,
Red and blue and green marks too, colors bright and bold!
Mark-making is fun to do, fun to do, fun to do,
Mark-making is fun to do, watch your story unfold!

**Actions/Gestures**:
1. Make scribbling motions in the air with your finger when singing "make some marks"
2. Trace imaginary lines and loops in front of you during "trace the lines and draw a loop"
3. Point to different colors around you or on your clothes during verse 2
4. Open arms wide when singing "watch your story unfold" to show sharing and expression

**Cost**: Free to $5 (using materials you likely have at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Gather all writing materials and arrange them within child's reach
2. Protect the table or surface with newspaper, plastic tablecloth, or use a washable surface
3. Select paper or writing surface—start with plain paper for maximum freedom
4. Ensure adequate lighting so child can see their marks clearly
5. Have damp cloths or wipes nearby for easy cleanup
6. Safety check: Use only non-toxic, washable materials

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Sit together at the writing area. Explain the science: "When you pick up a crayon, your motor cortex — the movement part of your brain — sends electrical signals down your arm to 34 tiny muscles in your hand. That's more muscles than in your entire back! Writing and drawing are some of the hardest things your brain can do." Show different tools and explain the pigment science: "This crayon is colored wax — the pigment inside absorbs certain light wavelengths and reflects others back to your eyes. That's why it looks red. This marker uses liquid ink instead of wax. And a pencil? That's graphite — a form of carbon — mixed with clay."

2. **Exploration** (10-15 min):
   Child freely explores making marks with various tools. Guide the science of each tool: "Press the crayon harder — more pigment transfers to the paper because more wax melts from friction. Press lighter — less pigment, lighter color." Compare tool physics: "The marker flows liquid ink through capillary action — the ink wicks along tiny fibers in the tip. The crayon deposits solid wax through friction. The pencil leaves graphite particles behind." Explore line types and connect to motor control: "Making a straight line uses different hand muscles than making a circle. Your brain is building new neural pathways right now — every mark you make strengthens the myelin around those pathways, making signals travel faster."

3. **Discovery** (2-3 min):
   Explore writing history: "Humans have only been writing for about 5,400 years — the first writing was cuneiform, pressed into clay tablets in Mesopotamia. Before that, for hundreds of thousands of years, people could only communicate face to face." Try different surfaces (rough vs. smooth paper, cardboard): "The texture affects how much pigment transfers — rough paper grabs more wax from the crayon. That's friction at work." Let the child experiment with pressure, speed, and tool angle independently.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Review the science together: "Your motor cortex practiced sending signals to your hand muscles today. Each time you practice, the myelin wrapping gets thicker, signals get faster, and your control improves — that's why marks get more precise over time." Point out the different pigment types used: "We made marks with wax, liquid ink, and graphite today — three completely different materials, all leaving color behind through different physical processes."

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus on the physical act and the brain science: "Your hand muscles are learning! Each scribble makes the myelin thicker."
- Use chunky crayons — explain why: "Thicker tools are easier because your hand muscles are still developing the fine control for thin tools"
- Compare two pigment types (crayon vs. marker): "Wax vs. liquid ink — watch how they look different on paper"
- Large paper encourages bigger arm movements — "You're using your deltoid and bicep muscles for big marks, and finger muscles for small marks"
- Vertical surfaces (easels) use different muscle groups than horizontal — try both and name the difference
- Accept scribbling as legitimate motor cortex development — these are real neural pathways being built
- Try the friction experiment: same crayon on smooth vs. rough paper

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce grapheme history: "Every letter started as a picture. 'A' was an upside-down ox head in Phoenician writing, 3,000 years ago. 'O' was an eye."
- Compare writing systems: show Chinese characters (logographic — each symbol = a word), Arabic (right-to-left), and Latin (left-to-right). Ask: "Why might different cultures write in different directions?"
- Practice fine motor precision: thin markers and colored pencils require more motor cortex control than chunky crayons
- Mix pigments: "What happens when you layer red and blue crayon? The two pigments absorb different wavelengths, and only the wavelengths neither absorbs (violet) reflect back"
- Introduce the graphite-to-clay ratio concept: "Soft pencils (more graphite) make darker lines; hard pencils (more clay) make lighter lines"
- Connect to myelination: "Notice how your circles are smoother today than last week? That's real brain growth — your neural pathways are getting faster"

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Textured Mark-Making**
Use various papers and surfaces (sandpaper, corrugated cardboard, bubble wrap under paper for rubbing). Place different textured materials under plain paper and rub crayons over them to create relief marks.

**Variation 2: Natural Mark-Making**
Collect sticks, leaves, or rocks and use them to make marks in sand, dirt, mud, or playdough. Create designs and patterns in natural materials—marks that can be erased and remade.

**Variation 3: Color Mixing Exploration**
Layer different colored markers or crayons on the same area to watch colors blend and change. Discuss what new colors appear when marks overlap.

**Repeat Play**
Each session offer new colors, different paper types, or fresh tools. Explore thematic variations: seasonal mark-making (winter white paper with white crayon, spring colors on pastel paper), holiday cards, weather-inspired designs, or story-based mark-making.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child eats or mouths writing materials
**Solution**: Use only non-toxic, washable crayons and markers certified safe for young children. Supervise closely and redirect: "Crayons are for paper, not for eating." Keep harmful materials completely out of reach. This is normal oral exploration at ages 2-3.

**Challenge**: Child wants to write on furniture, walls, or their body instead of paper
**Solution**: Calmly redirect to paper: "Markers are for paper. Here's your paper." Use washable materials only. Consider an easel or vertical surface specifically designated as "okay to mark on." This shows they understand the joy of mark-making; they just need to learn appropriate surfaces.

**Challenge**: Child creates marks without seeming to notice or care about what they've made
**Solution**: This is developmentally appropriate—the process is more important than the product at this age. Don't force product-focused thinking. Comment on the action: "You moved that crayon so fast!" rather than asking "What is it?"

**Challenge**: Child tears paper apart rather than marking on it
**Solution**: Offer both paper for tearing and paper for marking. Tearing is a developmentally appropriate fine motor activity. Use more durable paper (cardstock) if needed. Accept that some sessions will involve tearing—it's a valid exploratory activity.

**Challenge**: Child seems uninterested or refuses to participate
**Solution**: Don't force participation. Model mark-making yourself with genuine enjoyment. Leave materials available and try again another time. Some children engage better standing, moving, or with different tools. Respect their preferences—there's no "right age" to become interested in writing.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Alphabet Exploration**: As you go about your day, point out letters on signs, packages, and in books. "Look—that's the letter B, just like in your name!" This connects mark-making to real letters in the world.

2. **Name Tracing**: Write the child's name in large letters on paper and guide their finger or crayon to trace it. Repeat this often—it builds letter recognition and the special connection between their name and themselves.

3. **Story Marks**: After mark-making, ask the child to tell a story about their creation: "What's happening in your picture? Who are these marks?" Write down their words and read them back. This connects their visual expression to language and meaning.
