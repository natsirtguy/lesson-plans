# KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & CULTURE: Writing and Mark Making

## Activity Summary

Children explore the joy of making visible marks and early writing through painting, drawing, crayoning, and scribbling on various surfaces. This foundational experience builds fine motor control, hand-eye coordination, and self-expression while introducing the concept that marks and symbols can communicate ideas and feelings.

## Vocabulary

**Scribble**: Making lines and marks with a writing tool like a crayon or marker. When you move your hand across paper quickly with a pencil, you create scribbles that show your feelings and ideas.

**Mark-making**: Creating visible lines, dots, shapes, or patterns on a surface. Mark-making is what happens when you press a crayon on paper and move your hand—you leave a mark behind.

**Expression**: Showing and sharing your feelings, ideas, and creativity through actions, art, or words. When you paint a picture the way you want it, you're using expression to show what's inside your heart.

**Trace**: Following the outline or path of something with your finger or a pencil. When you move your pencil along a line slowly, you trace it, which helps you learn how letters and shapes are made.

## Learning Song

**Tune**: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

**Tempo**: Moderate

**Lyrics**

*Verse 1*

Scribble, scribble on the page,
Making marks so bright and free,
Lines and loops and swirls so wide,
All my feelings shown inside.

*Verse 2*

Crayons, markers, paint will do,
Colors mixed in every hue,
Tell your story through the marks,
Scribbles bright like rainbow sparks.

**Actions/Gestures**:

1. Make scribbling motions in the air with your hand moving freely in circles and lines
2. Point to different parts of your body (heart, head) when singing about feelings and expression
3. Sweep your arms wide when singing about "swirls so wide" and "colors mixed"

**Cost**: Free to $5 (using materials you likely have at home)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Preparation**:

1. Gather all writing materials and arrange them within child's reach
2. Protect the table or surface with newspaper, plastic tablecloth, or use a washable surface
3. Select paper or writing surface—start with plain paper for maximum freedom
4. Ensure adequate lighting so child can see their marks clearly
5. Have damp cloths or wipes nearby for easy cleanup
6. Safety check: Use only non-toxic, washable materials

**Activity Flow**:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 min):
   Sit down together at the writing area and show genuine excitement about the materials. Model making a simple mark or line on paper, describing what you're doing: "I'm making a big line across the paper." Hand the child a writing tool and invite them to try: "You make a mark too. What kind of mark will you make?" Observe what they create and comment on their actions without judgment. Emphasize that there is no "right way" to make marks.

2. **Exploration** (10-15 min):
   Child freely explores making marks with various tools and discovering how each creates different marks. Offer variety: "Would you like to try a different color?" or "What happens if you press harder?" Encourage experimentation with different directions: straight lines, circles, back-and-forth motions. Observe and comment without directing: "You're making so many marks!" or "I see red and blue marks together." Child may switch tools, colors, or paper sheets multiple times.

   Guide toward simple techniques while maintaining autonomy: Ask questions that encourage exploration: "Can you make a big mark? A small mark? A wiggly mark?" Demonstrate specific motions (circles, wavy lines, dots) and invite child to copy. Introduce letter-like shapes for older children without pressure. Support child's emerging ideas and celebrate the process over the product.

3. **Discovery** (2-3 min):
   Step back and allow extended independent exploration. Provide minimal narration—occasional comments that affirm without directing. Offer new paper when child shows interest in a fresh start. Resist the urge to help or correct. Ask open-ended questions: "What's your favorite mark you made?" or "Which color do you like best?" Avoid asking "What is it?" in ways that suggest their marks should represent something specific.

4. **Wrap-up** (2-3 min):
   Gather materials naturally as interest wanes. Review creations together without analysis: "You made many beautiful marks today." Ask open-ended reflection: "What was your favorite part?" or "What mark did you like making?" Make cleanup collaborative: "Let's put the crayons back together." Wipe hands together as part of the transition. Store finished papers in a portfolio, display, or recycle respectfully.

### Age Adaptations

**2-3 years**:
- Focus on the physical act of making marks rather than letter formation
- Use chunky crayons or markers that are easier to grip
- Keep sessions short (10-15 minutes) as attention span is shorter
- Keep materials simple: 3-4 colors maximum to avoid overwhelm
- Large paper encourages bigger movements and success
- Vertical writing surfaces (easels) often appeal more to this age
- Accept scribbling as legitimate mark-making—it's developmentally appropriate
- High adult support: stay actively engaged, modeling and narrating, frequent encouragement
- May need hand-over-hand guidance: gently guide their hand to show the motion

**3-4+ years**:
- Introduce letter-like shapes and simple letter formation (without pressure)
- Begin copying simple marks you make (horizontal lines, vertical lines, circles)
- Use more sophisticated tools: colored pencils, thin markers, chalk
- Add challenges: trace around stencils, decorate pictures, create patterns
- Introduce purposeful mark-making: "Write your name," "Make a card for someone"
- Encourage storytelling about their marks: "Tell me about what you made"
- Offer more color choices and allow child to select their own palette
- May sustain interest for 20-30 minutes or longer with new challenges

### Extension Ideas

**Variation 1: Textured Mark-Making**
Use various papers and surfaces (sandpaper, corrugated cardboard, bubble wrap under paper for rubbing). Place different textured materials under plain paper and rub crayons over them to create relief marks.

**Variation 2: Natural Mark-Making**
Collect sticks, leaves, or rocks and use them to make marks in sand, dirt, mud, or playdough. Create designs and patterns in natural materials—marks that can be erased and remade.

**Variation 3: Color Mixing Exploration**
Layer different colored markers or crayons on the same area to watch colors blend and change. Discuss what new colors appear when marks overlap.

**Repeat Play**
Each session offer new colors, different paper types, or fresh tools. Explore thematic variations: seasonal mark-making (winter white paper with white crayon, spring colors on pastel paper), holiday cards, weather-inspired designs, or story-based mark-making.

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child eats or mouths writing materials
**Solution**: Use only non-toxic, washable crayons and markers certified safe for young children. Supervise closely and redirect: "Crayons are for paper, not for eating." Keep harmful materials completely out of reach. This is normal oral exploration at ages 2-3.

**Challenge**: Child wants to write on furniture, walls, or their body instead of paper
**Solution**: Calmly redirect to paper: "Markers are for paper. Here's your paper." Use washable materials only. Consider an easel or vertical surface specifically designated as "okay to mark on." This shows they understand the joy of mark-making; they just need to learn appropriate surfaces.

**Challenge**: Child creates marks without seeming to notice or care about what they've made
**Solution**: This is developmentally appropriate—the process is more important than the product at this age. Don't force product-focused thinking. Comment on the action: "You moved that crayon so fast!" rather than asking "What is it?"

**Challenge**: Child tears paper apart rather than marking on it
**Solution**: Offer both paper for tearing and paper for marking. Tearing is a developmentally appropriate fine motor activity. Use more durable paper (cardstock) if needed. Accept that some sessions will involve tearing—it's a valid exploratory activity.

**Challenge**: Child seems uninterested or refuses to participate
**Solution**: Don't force participation. Model mark-making yourself with genuine enjoyment. Leave materials available and try again another time. Some children engage better standing, moving, or with different tools. Respect their preferences—there's no "right age" to become interested in writing.

### Follow-Up Activities

1. **Alphabet Exploration**: As you go about your day, point out letters on signs, packages, and in books. "Look—that's the letter B, just like in your name!" This connects mark-making to real letters in the world.

2. **Name Tracing**: Write the child's name in large letters on paper and guide their finger or crayon to trace it. Repeat this often—it builds letter recognition and the special connection between their name and themselves.

3. **Story Marks**: After mark-making, ask the child to tell a story about their creation: "What's happening in your picture? Who are these marks?" Write down their words and read them back. This connects their visual expression to language and meaning.
