# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Baseball and Throwing Games

## Activity Summary

Baseball and throwing games develop fundamental throwing skills, hand-eye coordination, and upper body strength while introducing children to catching and ball awareness. Through simple throwing activities, young learners build confidence in their ability to direct objects through space and develop the shoulder, arm, and core muscles needed for future sports. These play-based games teach turn-taking, spatial awareness, and celebrate the joy of movement and achievement.

**Activity Type**: Sport-based

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: High

**Best Environment**: Outdoor open space or gymnasium

**Space Required**: Large open area (25x25 feet minimum for throwing games)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Soft foam ball, yarn ball, or bean bag (4-6 inches, 2-4 ounces)
- Lightweight object for striking (oversized plastic bat, pool noodle, or rolled newspaper)
- Tee or cone to hold ball for striking (or adult hand)
- Plastic or foam bases (or mark with cones/towels)

**Optional enhancements**:
- Multiple balls of different textures
- Oversized bat (plastic or foam) for easier striking
- Target wall with tape markings
- Soft glove for catching practice
- Cones to mark base paths
- Colored balls for visibility

**DIY alternatives**:
- Roll newspaper tightly for bat
- Use rolled socks or newspaper as ball
- Use empty plastic bottles as bases
- Draw bases with chalk on pavement
- Use fabric strips tied to form bases
- Create wall target with tape

**Cost estimate**: Free (household items) to under $20

**Safety equipment**: Soft ball only (no hard baseballs), oversized bat only

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear area of rocks, sticks, hard edges, and obstacles
2. Mark safe throwing zone with cones or lines
3. Position bases in diamond formation (smaller for young children - 15-20 feet apart)
4. Create catch/ready positions behind catcher
5. Ensure soft ground surface if possible

**Boundaries**: Use cones, tape lines, or chalk to mark:
- Batter's box (where batter stands)
- Base positions (use towels, cones, or chalk circles)
- Foul territory (limits where thrown balls should go)

**Safety considerations**:
- Ensure all players are clear before throwing or batting
- Keep non-participants outside play area
- Use only soft balls and lightweight bats
- Avoid throwing at people (only toward bases/targets)
- Keep area free from hard surfaces if possible
- Establish clear "ready" and "go" signals

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare shoulders, arms, and legs for throwing and running; establish focus and coordination

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Arm windmills - rotate arms forward in circles 6-8 times, then backward
2. Shoulder rolls - roll shoulders backward 5 times, then forward 5 times
3. Walking with arm swings - walk around area while swinging arms naturally

**Warm-up cues**: "Let's get our shoulders ready for throwing!" / "Make big circles with your arms like windmills!" / "Feel your arms getting warm and loose!"

### Main Activity (8-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Show how to hold ball (in one hand, ready to throw)
- Demonstrate basic throw: raise ball to ear level, step forward with opposite foot, release ball toward target
- Show proper throwing stance and follow-through
- Key coaching point: "We're going to throw the ball gently toward the base or target - and celebrate every throw!"

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
1. **Holding the ball** - Grip ball in hand, ready position near ear/shoulder
2. **Throwing stance** - Feet apart, side-facing target, weight balanced
3. **Throwing motion** - Step forward, raise arm, release ball in smooth motion

**Coaching cues**:
- "Hold the ball like you're about to wave at a friend"
- "Step forward with your front foot when you throw"
- "Raise your arm up like you're reaching for a high shelf"
- "Let the ball roll off your fingers - gentle and smooth"
- "Follow through - your arm keeps moving after you release"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-8 minutes)

**Game structure**: "Toss and Run" (for younger) or "Simple Baseball" (for older)

**Simple version (ages 2-3)**:
- Adult or peer gently rolls ball to child
- Child gently throws ball back or toward target
- Then child chases where ball goes
- Adult celebrates and brings ball back
- Repeat - focus on the fun of throwing, not accuracy

**Advanced version (ages 3-4+)**:
- Set up simple bases in diamond shape (smaller diamond, 15-20 feet between bases)
- Adult or peer pitches gentle ball
- Child hits ball off tee with plastic bat or pool noodle
- Child runs to first base after hitting
- Other children retrieve ball and work together to pass to bases
- Rotate roles (everyone gets turn hitting and throwing)

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Throw gently (no hard throws)
2. Always throw toward bases or targets, not at people
3. Everyone gets a turn
4. Catch safely if ball comes to you

**Variations**:
- **Target throw**: Set up targets (cones, hula hoops) and throw ball to them
- **Wall throw**: Throw ball at wall/fence and chase where it bounces
- **Partner throw**: Stand with partner, take turns throwing ball back and forth (increase distance gradually)
- **Bowling**: Roll ball to knock down stacked plastic bottles
- **Catch practice**: Adult throws gently and child tries to catch (very forgiving catches)

**Turn-taking** (if applicable): Rotate through positions - batter becomes thrower, thrower becomes catcher, etc. Keep rotations simple and frequent so all children stay engaged.

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)
- Let children throw balls in different ways (overhand, underhand, side-arm)
- Encourage experimentation with throwing distance and strength
- Allow practice of catching or retrieving without pressure

**What to encourage**:
- "There are so many ways to throw a ball!"
- "See how far it goes when you throw different ways?"
- "You're getting stronger - look how far you threw it!"

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Lower heart rate gradually, celebrate achievements, wind down from high energy

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow walking while catching breath - walk around collecting equipment/balls
2. Upper body stretches - gentle stretch of arms, shoulders, back
3. Seated rest - sit and discuss favorite part of game

**Transition**: "What great throws! Our arms got a super workout. Now let's slow down and breathe..."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Skip batting - focus only on throwing and rolling
- Adult rolls ball to child; child throws it back
- Use very soft bean bags or yarn balls (easier to throw)
- Shorter throwing distances (3-5 feet)
- Celebrate any throwing motion, not accuracy
- No actual bases or running initially - just throw and chase
- Keep activity very playful and unstructured

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes total

**Adult support**: Very hands-on - demonstrate throwing motion repeatedly, assist with release, celebrate enthusiastically, do most of the retrieving to keep game moving

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Introduce hitting off tee with plastic bat
- Add base running component (simple circuit of 3-4 bases)
- Increase throwing distance and expect better accuracy
- Introduce actual team concepts (though keep teams small - 2-3 per side)
- Add catching practice with forgiving methods (larger target)
- Introduce simple scoring (runs count, basic understanding)
- Teach waiting for turn without losing focus

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Additional skills**:
- Hitting a ball with implement
- Understanding base path and running order
- Simple strategy (throwing to correct base)
- Catching with focus

## Extension Ideas

**At home**:
- Practice throwing into bucket or laundry basket
- Throw bean bags at paper targets
- Have catch partner practice with soft balls
- Create throwing target on ground (chalk circle)
- Practice hitting plastic ball off tee in driveway
- Make balls from rolled newspaper or socks

**Make it harder**:
- Increase throwing distance progressively
- Introduce underhand and sidearm throws
- Use smaller targets
- Add base running with multiple bases
- Introduce catching with smaller, lighter ball
- Create obstacle course between throwing position and target
- Play on varied terrain (slight incline)

**Make it easier**:
- Very short throwing distances (2-3 feet)
- Adult throws to child; child practices catching only
- Larger, softer ball
- Low target or large basket as catch area
- Focus only on throwing action, not games
- Let child stand close to base to ensure success

## Safety and Supervision

### Constant Supervision
- Stay visible to all children in play area at all times
- Pay close attention during throwing and batting
- Watch for unsafe throwing patterns (toward people instead of targets)
- Monitor for collisions as children run to bases

### Equipment Safety
- Use only soft foam balls or yarn balls (never hard baseballs)
- Use only plastic bats, pool noodles, or oversized bats (never adult bats)
- Inspect ball and bat regularly for damage
- Ensure bat grip is appropriate for small hands
- Keep all equipment soft and age-appropriate

### Throwing Safety
- Establish rule: "Only throw toward bases and targets, never at people"
- Monitor throwing force - redirect if throwing too hard
- Keep all non-players outside throwing zone
- Call "BALL!" clearly if ball goes wild
- Never allow throwing at each other in anger or frustration

### Batting Safety
- Clear area behind and in front of batter
- Establish "ready" signal before batting begins
- No one should stand behind batter while they swing
- Use lightweight bat only
- Ensure batter has adequate space to swing safely

### When to Take a Break
- If child seems frustrated or fatigued
- If unsafe throwing or batting behavior emerges
- If focus is clearly lost
- Every 5-7 minutes for 2-3 year olds
- After any unsafe incident (reset expectations)
- If arguments about turns or rules emerge

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

**What to say**:
- "Great throw! You're getting really good at this!"
- "I love how you followed through with your arm!"
- "That was so close to the base!"
- "Everyone throws in their own special way - and that's great!"
- "You tried so hard - that takes real strength!"

**What to avoid**:
- Correcting every attempt (let them develop naturally)
- Focusing only on accurate throws or hits
- Comparing abilities between children
- Using "perfect" language or excessive praise
- Expressing frustration with their performance
- Making it feel like a competitive sport too early

**When to help**:
- Guide throwing arm through motion (if struggling)
- Demonstrate the motion while they watch
- Adjust distance as needed to ensure success
- Provide encouragement between each attempt
- Help with running to bases (hold hand if uncertain)
- Position yourself as retriever to keep pace moving

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child throws ball in wrong direction or can't control where it goes

**Why**: Directional throwing is complex; young children often throw without aiming first

**Solution**: Practice with very close targets (2-3 feet away). Point at target before throwing. Use oversized target (large hoop, bucket). Start throwing at wall (easier to track). Do lots of demonstration.

**Timeline**: Directional accuracy develops significantly by age 4; weekly practice helps

---

**Challenge**: Child won't throw hard enough or throws too hard with no control

**Why**: Force regulation is difficult at young ages; excitement increases throwing force

**Solution**: Use extremely light ball (bean bag, yarn ball). Show slow-motion throwing. Practice with stationary target first. Use word cues "gentle throw." Start much closer to target. Redirect excessive force without scolding.

**Timeline**: Better force control develops with practice; expect improvement in 3-4 weeks

---

**Challenge**: Child gets hit by ball and becomes fearful or upset

**Why**: Getting hit feels scary; negative experience can create reluctance to play

**Solution**: Use softer ball. Increase distance. Practice throwing at targets instead of people. Resume with different activity if fear is high. Validate feelings: "That scared you - let's use an even softer ball." Use positive experiences to rebuild confidence.

**Timeline**: Confidence returns as they see the ball is safe; 1-2 positive sessions usually help

---

**Challenge**: Child lacks patience for waiting turns or wants all the playing time

**Why**: Young children struggle with turn-taking and waiting; immediate gratification is natural

**Solution**: Minimize waiting by rotating quickly. Give each child multiple turns in sequence. Use system like "3 throws each, then switch." Include child in retrieving (gives them role). Prepare distraction activity during wait (look for birds, count throws, etc.).

**Timeline**: Turn-taking improves with age and practice; consistent structure helps

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Throws ball toward intended target
- Uses overhand throwing motion consistently
- Shows improved distance with each week
- Demonstrates follow-through on throw
- Can catch or field rolling ball
- Understands base-running direction
- Shows patience waiting for turn
- Expresses excitement about playing

**Progression over weeks/months**:
- Week 1-2: Any throwing attempt, excitement about activity
- Week 3-4: Directional throws toward general target area
- Week 5-8: Better accuracy and increased throwing distance
- Month 3+: Can hit ball off tee, run bases, show game understanding

**When to add challenge**: When child demonstrates consistent directional throwing and can wait patiently for 2+ turns without major complaint
