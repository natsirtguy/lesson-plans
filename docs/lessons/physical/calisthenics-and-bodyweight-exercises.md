# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Calisthenics and Bodyweight Exercises

## Activity Summary

Calisthenics and bodyweight exercises are simple, natural movements using just the child's body to build strength, coordination, and body awareness. These activities develop gross motor skills, core stability, and muscle control while being fun, accessible, and requiring no equipment. Perfect for building confidence in physical movement and establishing healthy movement patterns from an early age.

**Activity Type**: Motor skill development / Gross motor play

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Moderate to High

**Best Environment**: Indoor gymnasium / Living room / Backyard / Park

**Space Required**: 10x10 feet minimum (larger is better for running space)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Child's own body - that's all!
- Clear floor space
- Soft surface optional (yoga mat, carpet, grass)

**Optional enhancements**:
- Soft yoga mat for floor exercises - provides cushioning and defines activity space
- Mirror - helps children see their movements and builds body awareness
- Music player - adds rhythm and makes movements fun
- Colored tape or chalk - marks boundaries and targets on floor

**DIY alternatives**:
- No equipment needed - use your home as is
- Blanket on floor for cushioning
- Outdoor grass provides natural soft surface
- Hum or clap to create rhythm if no music available

**Cost estimate**: Free (household items)

**Safety equipment**: None required, but soft mat recommended for comfort

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear the play area of toys, sharp corners, and tripping hazards
2. Ensure adequate ceiling height (at least 7 feet for arm movements)
3. Remove breakable items from nearby tables and shelves
4. Check flooring is dry and non-slip
5. Have water nearby for hydration breaks

**Boundaries**:
- Use natural room boundaries or mark with tape/chalk
- Create a "movement zone" about 10x10 feet
- Ensure at least 2 feet of clearance around the child in all directions

**Safety considerations**:
- Supervise closely - young children can lose balance suddenly
- Start on soft surface (mat, carpet, or grass) to prevent falls
- Watch for dizziness from spinning movements - keep duration short
- Ensure child is not overheated - take breaks if needed
- Stop immediately if child shows signs of fatigue or distress
- Keep movements controlled - avoid high-impact jumping until 3+ years

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepares the body for movement, increases heart rate gradually, and gets the child excited about active play.

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Marching in place - "Let's march like soldiers! Lift your knees up and down!"
2. Gentle arm circles - "Make big circles with your arms, round and round"
3. Slow walking while swinging arms - "Walk around the room, let your arms swing loose and free"

**Warm-up cues**:
- "Feel your body waking up!"
- "We're getting ready to move!"
- "Let's get our muscles ready!"

### Main Activity (8-12 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Show the child what you'll be doing today in a fun, non-pressured way
- Demonstrate movements slowly and exaggerated so they're easy to understand
- Make it playful: "We're going to move like different animals!"

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Skill breakdown** (introduce one at a time):

**Movement 1: Standing Tall**
- Stand with feet about shoulder-width apart
- Keep body straight from head to toes
- Gentle engagement of core (without saying technical words)
- Practice: "Stand as tall as a giraffe!" then "Make yourself smaller like a penguin"

**Movement 2: Squats (Assisted)**
- Start in standing position
- Adult holds child's hands or child holds onto furniture
- Bend knees slightly, lowering body a few inches
- Return to standing
- Practice: "Sit back like you're sitting in a chair, then stand back up!"

**Movement 3: Marching with High Knees**
- March in place, lifting knees up high
- Arms move naturally with each step
- Practice: "Lift your knees high! Step, step, step!"

**Movement 4: Arm Movements**
- Reach arms up high toward ceiling
- Sweep arms out to sides
- Practice: "Stretch up to the sky! Now stretch out wide!"

**Coaching cues**:
- "Keep your body tight and straight - like a strong tree!"
- "Move slowly and controlled - you're stronger when you go slower"
- "I can see your muscles working! That's strength!"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-6 minutes)

**Game 1: Mirror Movements**
- Adult does a simple bodyweight movement
- Child copies the movement
- Take turns being the "leader"
- Movements: squats, arm reaches, marching, turning

**Game 2: Freeze Dance**
- Play music or clap rhythm
- Child moves around and does bodyweight exercises
- When music stops, child freezes in their position
- Resume when music starts again
- Movements: marching, bouncing gently, arm swings

**Game 3: Animal Movements**
- Call out an animal
- Child demonstrates how that animal moves using their body
- Examples: "Giraffe reaches tall!" "Penguin waddles!" "Bird flaps wings!"
- Keep it playful and celebration-focused

**Turn-taking**:
- For mirror game: alternate every 2-3 movements
- For freeze dance: play for 20-30 seconds, freeze for 10 seconds
- No strict waiting - child participates the whole time

#### Free Exploration (1-2 minutes)
- Let child move however they want in the space
- Encourage trying movements they saw you do
- Celebrate all attempts: "Look how you're moving! That's wonderful!"
- Observe what movements they enjoy most

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually lowers heart rate, calms the nervous system, and brings awareness back to the body.

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow walking with deep breathing - "Take slow steps, breathe in and out"
2. Gentle stretching standing - "Reach one arm up, then the other, like you're reaching for clouds"
3. Seated or lying rest - "Lie down and feel your body relax, just like a sleeping puppy"

**Transition**:
- Gradually slow movements
- Lower voice volume
- Transition to sitting or lying down
- Use calming language: "Your body is doing such a good job, let's rest now"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Movements should be gentle and more supported
- Adult provides hand-holding support for balance and stability
- Keep movements very simple - single movements, not combinations
- Use much more playful language and storytelling
- Shorter work periods with more frequent breaks
- Focus on body awareness rather than repetition
- Don't worry about form - celebrate any attempt to move

**Duration**: 8-12 minutes (including warm-up and cool-down)

**Adult support**:
- Hands-on support for balance during squats and movements
- Constant verbal encouragement and enthusiasm
- Modeling every movement
- Frequent check-ins for fatigue or overstimulation

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Introduce longer sequences: "squat, then reach up, then march"
- Add repetitions: "Do 5 squats together, let's count!"
- Include balance challenges: "Can you stand on one foot?"
- Add variations: "Do squats slowly, now do them fast"
- Introduce gentle jump squats (for older 3.5+) - land softly with both feet
- Create more complex games with multiple rules
- Encourage child to suggest movements to do together

**Duration**: 12-15 minutes (children this age can sustain longer focus)

**Advanced extensions**:
- Teach proper form for movements like push-ups against wall
- Introduce body awareness cues: "Feel your leg muscles working!"
- Create longer movement sequences: 5-6 different movements in order
- Partner exercises with other children (when appropriate)

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

**What to say**:
- "I can see your muscles getting stronger!"
- "You're doing a great job listening to your body!"
- "That took courage to try! I'm proud of you!"
- "Your body is amazing - look what it can do!"
- "Let's see what happens when you move that way!"

**What to avoid**:
- Don't compare your child to other children
- Don't force participation - allow them to watch first if shy
- Don't correct form constantly - keep it fun first
- Don't push for more repetitions if child shows fatigue
- Avoid saying "You can't do it yet" - instead say "Let's work on that together"

**When to help**:
- Provide hand support when child attempts balance movements
- Step in before falls happen - anticipate loss of balance
- Help when child asks ("Can you help me?")
- Demonstrate again if movement is confusing
- Let them struggle a bit to build resilience, but don't let them fall

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't do movements correctly or keeps falling
**Why**: At this age, balance and coordination are still developing. They may lack the strength or proprioceptive awareness needed.
**Solution**: Provide more hand support, reduce the range of motion (smaller squats), practice near furniture for support, celebrate attempts rather than perfect form
**Timeline**: Proper form develops gradually over months - expect wobbly squats at age 2, more controlled movements by 3.5+

**Challenge**: Child gets bored quickly or won't focus
**Why**: Young children have very short attention spans (8-15 minutes is realistic). They need variety and novelty.
**Solution**: Change activities frequently (every 2-3 minutes), use music and songs, make it story-based ("We're strong dinosaurs!"), let them choose what to do next
**Timeline**: Attention span naturally increases - 2-year-olds may only focus 5 minutes, 3.5-year-olds can do 10-15

**Challenge**: Child seems tired or complains legs hurt
**Why**: Young children are still building aerobic fitness and may genuinely be tired or experiencing growing pains.
**Solution**: Take a break, sit and rest, offer water, switch to gentler movements, it's okay to stop early, never force continuation
**Timeline**: Stamina improves over weeks and months - this is normal development

**Challenge**: Child shows fear of movements (won't try squats or jumping)
**Why**: They may have had a fall or scary experience, lack confidence, or simply be cautious by nature.
**Solution**: Start with movements they're confident with, build gradually, provide lots of reassurance and hand-holding, let them go at their own pace, celebrate small progress
**Timeline**: Confidence builds slowly - don't rush, some children are naturally cautious and that's fine

### Safety Reminders
- Always supervise directly - don't step away even for a moment
- Check that the child is not overheating - they overheat faster than adults
- Stop immediately if the child complains of pain (not just fatigue)
- Avoid high-impact activities until age 3+ (jumping can stress developing joints)
- Keep the area clear of hazards - even simple movements can lead to falls
- Watch for signs of overexertion: heavy breathing, excessive sweating, complaints of being hot/tired
- Never force participation - a child who wants to sit and watch is still learning

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Child can do movements with less adult support and hand-holding
- Movements become smoother and more controlled
- Child can follow a sequence: "do squat, then reach up" without reminding
- Balance improves - fewer wobbly moments
- Child initiates wanting to do movements again
- Form improves naturally over time without correcting

**When to add challenge**:
- When child easily does movements multiple times without fatigue
- When they ask for "harder" or want to try new things
- When they can do a movement sequence without help
- When their confidence is growing and they're eager to participate
- Usually around every 2-3 weeks as they gain strength and coordination
