# Dance Choreography and Routines

## Activity Summary

Choreography is the art of designing movement in space and time — organizing gestures, steps, and body shapes into intentional sequences that communicate something or create an aesthetic effect. Children learn what choreographers actually think about: spatial levels (high, medium, low), dynamics (sharp vs. flowing, fast vs. slow), 8-count phrasing (how dancers count music), and motifs (a repeated movement idea that forms the building block of a dance). This is not just dancing to music — it's an introduction to movement composition as a genuine art form.

**Activity Type**: Performance Arts

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Moderate to High

**Best Environment**: Indoor gymnasium, living room, or outdoor open space with level ground

**Space Required**: 15x15 feet minimum (enough for children to move without bumping into each other)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Music player or device (phone, tablet, speaker) - capable of playing songs and adjusting volume
- Child-friendly music with strong, clear beats (age-appropriate songs)
- Open floor space free of obstacles

**Optional enhancements**:
- Ribbons or scarves (12-24 inches long) - adds visual flow to movement
- Lightweight props (foam wands, maracas, shakers) - encourages interaction with movement
- Large mirror or reflective surface - children enjoy seeing themselves move
- Glow sticks or LED bracelets (if dancing in dim light) - creates excitement and visual focus

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use hairbands or fabric scraps as ribbons; create simple shakers from water bottles filled with dry rice or beans; use a smartphone's built-in speaker or borrow a portable Bluetooth speaker

**Cost estimate**: Free to $15 (most families have music players; ribbons/props are optional)

**Safety equipment**: None required, though a non-slip surface is ideal

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear the space completely - remove toys, furniture edges, and any tripping hazards
2. Ensure the floor is clean and non-slip (wipe down if needed)
3. Check that music player is functioning and speaker volume is appropriate (loud enough to hear clearly, but not loud enough to startle)
4. Place music player or speaker in a safe, stable location away from children
5. Ensure adequate ventilation - active movement generates heat

**Boundaries**:
- Define the dance area with a large circle you describe verbally ("we dance in this big space")
- Use visual markers if needed (tape line, yoga mat boundary) for older toddlers
- Keep safe distance from walls (3 feet minimum) to prevent collisions

**Safety considerations**:
- **Slipping hazard**: Use non-slip footwear or dance barefoot on carpeted areas; if on hard floors, use sticky socks or shoes with grip
- **Overheating**: Dress children in light layers they can remove; have water available for breaks
- **Dizziness/disorientation**: Limit spinning movements for 2-3 year-olds; watch for signs of dizziness (stumbling, losing balance repeatedly)
- **Music volume**: Keep at conversational level or slightly louder (60-75 decibels max) to protect hearing
- **Fatigue**: Allow frequent rest breaks; watch for signs of tiredness (heavy breathing, sitting down, loss of interest)
- **Spacing**: Ensure 3-4 feet between children to prevent accidental collisions during movement

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Wake up the body, establish rhythm awareness, and prepare muscles for more active movement. The warm-up sets a joyful tone and helps children transition into "dance mode."

**Warm-up activities**:
1. **Gentle body awareness** - Touch different body parts as you name them ("Can you touch your nose? Your shoulders? Your belly?") while moving in place. This helps younger children focus and transition attention to their bodies.

2. **Slow swaying** - Play soft, slow music (or hum) and invite children to "sway like trees in a gentle breeze" or "like seaweed in water." Model swaying side to side with arms loose. This is calming and establishes the connection between music and movement.

3. **Marching in place** - Switch to music with a clear, steady beat. March in place together, lifting knees in time with the music. Say "Listen to the beat - boom, boom, boom" to build rhythm awareness. Make it playful: "We're marching like elephants/drums/soldiers."

**Warm-up cues**:
- "Can you feel the music in your feet?"
- "The beat goes boom, boom, boom - listen!"
- "Let your body wake up - shake it out!"

### Main Activity (8-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2-3 minutes)

Explain what choreography actually is: "Choreography is how dancers plan their movements — like writing a story, but with your body instead of words. Choreographers make decisions about three things: **space** (where you move and at what level — high up, middle, or low), **time** (fast or slow, and on which beat), and **energy** (sharp and sudden, or smooth and flowing)."

Introduce **8-count phrasing**: "Dancers count music in groups of eight. Let's listen." Clap or count along with the music: "1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8." Say: "Each phrase is 8 counts. Choreographers plan which movement happens on which count."

Introduce **spatial levels**: Show three positions — arms stretched high overhead (high level), arms out to the sides at shoulder height (middle level), and crouching low with hands near the floor (low level). Say: "Interesting choreography uses all three levels — not just standing up the whole time."

Introduce **motif**: "A motif is one movement idea you return to throughout the dance — like a theme. We'll pick a motif and keep coming back to it." Choose something simple: a swooping arm movement, a hop-turn, or a body shape.

Play a snippet of the chosen song and demonstrate the first movement slowly, exaggerating your movements so children can clearly see what you're doing.

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Skill breakdown** — Build choreography using real choreographic choices:

1. **Choose and practice the motif** (8 counts): Pick a simple movement that will recur throughout — a swooping arm, a stomp-and-clap, a spinning half-turn. Practice it together until it feels natural. Say: "This is our motif. We'll come back to it every time."

2. **Add a contrasting movement** (8 counts): Choreographers use contrast — if the motif is big and sweeping, the contrasting move is small and contained. If the motif is high level, the contrast is low level. Practice the contrasting move in isolation, then connect: "Motif for 8 counts, then contrast for 8 counts."

3. **Vary the dynamics**: Practice the motif once sharply ("jerky, sudden — like a robot") and once smoothly ("slow and flowing — like seaweed"). Say: "Same move, but different energy. Choreographers change the energy to create different feelings."

4. **Put it together**: Motif (8 counts) → contrast (8 counts) → motif with different dynamics (8 counts) → ending shape (hold a pose for 4 counts). This is a complete mini-choreography with intentional structure.

**Coaching cues**:
- "Watch me first, then copy what I do"
- "The music tells us when to move - listen for the beat"
- "There's no wrong way to dance - just have fun with it!"
- "Keep your eyes on me and move with the music"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-8 minutes)

**Game structure**:
- Play the full song or song section (usually 30-90 seconds for young children's music)
- Perform the learned choreography together with the children
- Use the music's structure to guide when to do which movement
- Celebrate completion: "You did the whole dance! You're amazing dancers!"

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. We move to the music
2. We do our special moves when the music tells us to
3. Everyone gets to have fun (no judgments about how movements look)

**Variations**:
- **Simpler version**: Reduce choreography to 1-2 repeating movements instead of a full sequence
- **More complex version**: Add hand movements to leg/body movements (clap while hopping, wave arms while stepping)
- **With props**: Incorporate ribbons or scarves - children wave them while moving, adding visual interest
- **Call and response**: You move first, children copy, then you change and they follow
- **Freeze dance**: Play music, children dance freely, when music stops they freeze in a silly pose

**Turn-taking** (if applicable):
If doing individual demonstrations, keep them very brief (5-10 seconds each). Younger toddlers often prefer dancing as a group rather than individually.

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

- Play music and let children move however they want
- Encourage them to experiment: "Can you dance low? Can you dance fast? Can you make up your own moves?"
- Dance alongside them, modeling confidence and joy
- Observe what movements they naturally create - these show comfort and personality
- Offer gentle suggestions rather than corrections: "Look how high you're jumping! Can you jump even higher?"

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually lower activity level and heart rate, signaling transition out of vigorous movement. The cool-down helps prevent dizziness and returns focus to breathing and body awareness.

**Cool-down activities**:
1. **Slow, big stretches** - Stand and gently reach arms up high ("reach for the sky") then down toward toes. Repeat 3-4 times, pausing between each stretch. Say "Stretch... and relax..."

2. **Gentle swaying to softer music** - Return to the slow, swaying movement from warm-up. Play calmer, quieter music (instrumental or soft vocals). Say "Our bodies are getting quieter now, like the music."

3. **Deep breathing with movement** - Have children place hands on chest or belly. Breathe in deeply (count to 4) while raising arms, then breathe out (count to 4) while lowering arms. Say "Big breath in... and out... good job, body!"

**Transition**:
Finish with a calming statement: "Our dance is all done. Our bodies did so many wonderful things today. Let's sit down for a little rest" (and then transition to snack, quiet play, or next activity).

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Use only 1-2 very simple movements (clapping, hopping in place, swaying) rather than a complex sequence
- Keep choreography to 8-16 total counts (very short)
- Choose upbeat music with clear, simple lyrics that children can anticipate
- Provide significant adult modeling and hand-over-hand guidance if needed
- Use shorter music clips (30-45 seconds)
- Include lots of repetition of the same movements rather than varied sequences
- Allow children to sit or stand - don't require continuous participation
- Use very simple verbal cues ("clap, clap, clap") that match the beat

**Duration**: 8-12 minutes total (including warm-up and cool-down)

**Adult support**:
- Stand close by and demonstrate each movement multiple times
- Use hand-over-hand assistance for new movements
- Provide frequent encouragement and positive feedback
- Be ready to help children regain balance
- Join in dancing rather than just directing

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Increase choreography length to 32+ counts with 3-4 sections and a recurring motif
- Introduce **canon**: you perform the motif, then the child copies it one phrase later — the same movement offset in time, like a round in music
- Add directional changes and spatial pathways ("travel to the right for 8 counts, then return")
- Use music with verse/chorus structure and choreograph differently for each section — high energy for the chorus, flowing and low-level for the verse
- Have the child invent their own motif and teach it to you — this is actual choreographic composition
- Introduce **unison vs. contrast**: both performers doing the same thing at the same time (unison) vs. doing complementary but different things (contrast)

**Duration**: Can extend to 15-20 minutes with more varied movement vocabulary

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**:
  - "I love how you're moving your feet to the beat!"
  - "That's a fun move - I like the way you're dancing!"
  - "You remembered the moves - you're learning this dance!"
  - "Keep going, you're doing great!"

- **What to avoid**:
  - Correcting how their body looks ("That's not right" or "Do it like this")
  - Comparing one child's dancing to another ("See how [other child] is doing it?")
  - Using phrases that emphasize performance rather than joy ("You need to do this better")
  - Sitting passively - children learn best when they see adults dancing too

- **When to help**:
  - Provide hand-over-hand guidance when teaching a new movement
  - Step in if a child loses balance or looks unsafe
  - Offer a reminder if they forget what comes next ("What's our next move?")
  - Let them struggle productively with timing - don't immediately correct if they're slightly off the beat

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child freezes or refuses to participate and just watches

**Why**: Some children need observation time before trying new activities. This is developmentally normal and not a sign of failure.

**Solution**: Continue dancing yourself and invite gently without pressure ("Would you like to try?" "You can dance however feels good to you"). Position yourself where they can easily see you. Often after watching for 2-3 minutes, they'll join in. Keep participation completely voluntary.

**Timeline**: By 3.5-4 years, most children will attempt participation after observation time. Persistence without pressure is key.

---

**Challenge**: Child can't remember the sequence of movements

**Why**: Memory for sequences develops gradually. 2-3 year-olds typically can only hold 1-2 steps in mind; 3-4 year-olds can manage 3-4.

**Solution**: Reduce the number of movements in the choreography. Use only 1-2 moves repeated multiple times rather than a varied sequence. Add verbal cues that match the movement ("clap, clap, jump, jump"). Practice the same choreography across multiple days - repetition helps memory solidify.

**Timeline**: By age 4-5, children can learn and remember 6-8 movement sequences. Until then, simplicity and repetition are essential.

---

**Challenge**: Child moves too fast or too slow and doesn't match the beat

**Why**: Rhythm and beat matching develop gradually over early childhood. This skill typically isn't solid until age 5-6.

**Solution**: Don't focus on perfect timing. Celebrate the fact they're moving. Use exaggerated movements and clear verbal counts ("ONE, two, three, four") to help them feel the beat. Try clapping or patting the beat together before dancing. Choose music with very clear, strong beats.

**Timeline**: Expect approximate beat matching around age 4; true beat matching develops around age 5-6.

---

**Challenge**: Child gets dizzy, stumbles, or seems uncoordinated

**Why**: Young children's balance systems are still developing, and inner ear coordination continues refining through age 5+.

**Solution**: Limit spinning movements for 2-3 year-olds. For any child showing dizziness, have them sit down and rest. Avoid choreography that requires complex balance. Use movements that feel stable (marching, swaying, clapping).

**Timeline**: Balance improves steadily. Revisit spinning and more complex movements as they age.

---

**Challenge**: One child copies other children instead of learning the choreography

**Why**: Imitation and peer learning are actually developmentally appropriate! Young children learn by watching peers.

**Solution**: This isn't a problem - let it happen. However, if you want them to focus on you, position yourself where their attention naturally goes and use enthusiastic, exaggerated movements they'll focus on.

**Timeline**: As children age, they can follow direct instruction more easily, but peer learning remains valuable throughout early childhood.

### Safety Reminders
- **Stop immediately if any child shows signs of dizziness, shortness of breath, or discomfort** - take a break and let them rest
- **Check footwear before dancing** - ensure shoes/socks have grip or remove them if dancing on slippery surfaces
- **Watch for overheating** - dress children in light layers and have water breaks every 5-10 minutes during active dancing
- **Maintain adequate spacing** - ensure 3-4 feet between children to prevent collisions
- **Be alert to children who tire quickly** - younger children and those with less energy should be allowed to rest without judgment
- **Avoid rapid spinning or direction changes for children under 3** - these increase dizziness risk
- **Keep the space clear of hazards** - do one final safety sweep before starting

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Begins to anticipate movements and starts the move slightly before being told (memory improvement)
- Steps more consistently with the beat (rhythm awareness developing)
- Maintains better balance while moving in different directions
- Shows increased confidence and less hesitation when trying new movements
- Attempts to add their own moves or variations
- Can follow 2-3 movements in sequence without demonstration

**When to add challenge**:
- When they can successfully complete the choreography with minimal prompting (usually after 3-5 repetitions across different sessions)
- When they show confidence and ask to "dance more" or "do the dance again"
- When they can follow along while looking at the teacher/parent only periodically instead of constantly
- When they begin creating their own movements and variations
