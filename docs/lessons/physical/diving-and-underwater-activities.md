# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Diving and Underwater Activities

## Activity Summary

Diving and underwater activities introduce young children to water confidence, breath control, and basic diving movements in shallow water environments. This activity builds aquatic motor skills, body awareness in water, breathing coordination, and introduces foundational swimming techniques. It's beneficial for developing water comfort, safety awareness, and the coordination required for aquatic sports.

**Activity Type**: Aquatic Sport

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Moderate to High

**Best Environment**: Shallow swimming pool, beach in shallow water, or bathtub (for younger children)

**Space Required**: Shallow water area (18-36 inches deep maximum for ages 2-3, 3-4 feet for ages 3-4+)

## Vocabulary

**Buoyancy**: The upward force that water pushes on everything in it — discovered by Archimedes around 250 BCE. An object floats if the water it displaces weighs more than the object itself. Your body is mostly water, so humans are close to neutrally buoyant — we almost float. Adding air to your lungs makes you more buoyant (you rise); exhaling makes you less buoyant (you sink). Understanding buoyancy is the key to controlling depth underwater.

**Mammalian dive reflex**: An automatic response your body triggers when your face contacts cold water — your heart rate slows by 10-25%, blood redirects to vital organs, and your spleen releases extra oxygen-carrying red blood cells. All mammals have it, from humans to dolphins to dogs. It conserves oxygen, allowing longer breath-holds. Babies have an especially strong dive reflex, which is why infant swimming programs exist.

**Hydrostatic pressure**: The pressure water exerts on your body, increasing with depth. At the surface, air pressure is 1 atmosphere (atm). Every 10 meters of water depth adds another atmosphere of pressure. Even in shallow water, children can feel pressure on their eardrums — that's hydrostatic pressure squeezing the air in the ear canal. Equalizing (gently blowing with nose pinched) pushes air back and relieves the pressure.

**Diaphragm**: The dome-shaped muscle below your lungs that controls breathing. When it contracts (flattens down), your lungs expand and air rushes in. When it relaxes (domes up), air is pushed out. Learning to control the diaphragm is essential for breath-holding — a deep diaphragmatic breath fills the lungs completely, maximizing oxygen for underwater activities. The diaphragm is the most important respiratory muscle.

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Shallow pool or water area (certified safe)
- Flotation devices (water wings, noodles) - optional but recommended for beginners
- Diving rings or weighted toys (designed for children)
- Non-slip water shoes or sandals
- Large towels (at least 2)
- Waterproof thermometer (check water temperature 75-80 degrees F)

**Optional enhancements**:
- Diving sticks or diving discs
- Floating targets or rings
- Waterproof goggles (age appropriate)
- Small kickboards
- Underwater toys or balls
- Step stool or small ladder for entry/exit

**DIY alternatives**: Brightly colored plastic cups weighted with water, tennis balls with water, plastic containers

**Cost estimate**: Free to under $10 (if using existing pool)

**Safety equipment**: Coast Guard approved life jacket (if needed), rescue pole, first aid kit poolside

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Inspect water area for safety hazards, sharp edges, or debris
2. Ensure water temperature is warm (75-80 degrees F for young children)
3. Check depth markers and boundaries clearly marked
4. Set up a designated entry/exit point with grab handles
5. Place all equipment within arm's reach but outside water
6. Have towels, dry clothes, and change area ready

**Boundaries**: Use rope markers or cones to define shallow water area; establish clear "deep water" boundary where children cannot go

**Safety considerations**:
- Maintain constant adult supervision - never leave child unattended in or near water
- Use appropriate life jackets or flotation devices for non-swimmers
- Ensure water temperature is appropriate (too cold causes shivering)
- Check for pool chemicals or saltwater safety (if applicable)
- Watch for signs of fatigue or cold (shivering, chattering teeth)
- Establish clear signal for "get out of water" (whistle or verbal cue)
- Ensure certified lifeguard present at public facilities
- Have rescue equipment and first aid immediately available

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Acclimate body to water temperature, build confidence, loosen muscles

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Wade in shallow water with arm movements - "Walk in the water and move your arms like a windmill"
2. Splash and feel the water - "Splash the water with your hands and feet - it's fun!"
3. Controlled jumping in place - "Jump up and down in the shallow part, feel the water bounce with you"

**Warm-up cues**: "The water feels nice and cool. Let's get our bodies ready to have fun diving and exploring underwater"

### Main Activity (6-10 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Explain buoyancy: "Water pushes UP on you — that's called buoyancy. When you fill your lungs with air, you float more. When you breathe out, you sink a little. You can control whether you go up or down!"
- Introduce the diaphragm: "Take a deep breath — feel your belly push out? That's your diaphragm muscle pulling down to make room for air in your lungs. A big diaphragm breath gives you more oxygen for staying underwater"
- Mention the dive reflex: "When your face touches the water, your body automatically slows your heart down to save oxygen. It's called the mammalian dive reflex — all mammals have it, even whales!"
- Emphasize that it's okay to take their time and feel scared at first

#### Skill Practice (3-4 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
1. **Breath control**: Take a deep breath through mouth, hold, blow bubbles out
2. **Face entry**: Bend forward, let face touch water while holding breath
3. **Head submersion**: Gradually put head underwater with eyes open
4. **Forward dive or roll**: Gentle forward motion with head leading

**Coaching cues**:
- "Take a big breath in - like you're smelling flowers"
- "Blow bubbles like a fish - pbbbbb"
- "Put your face in the water like you're looking for treasure"
- "Roll forward gently like a log - head first"
- "Great job! You're so brave exploring underwater"

#### Guided Play/Game (3-4 minutes)

**Game structure**: "Treasure Hunt" - Children dive or duck down to retrieve floating toys/rings

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Only dive when an adult says it's okay
2. Take a breath before going down
3. Come up when you feel like coming up
4. All diving happens in the shallow area

**Variations**:
- Ring dive: Toss weighted ring, child dives to retrieve
- Color search: "Find the blue toy underwater"
- Bubble race: "Who can blow the most bubbles?"
- Marco Polo adaptation: Simpler version with adult directing child to shallow targets
- Kick and dive: "Kick your feet while moving forward, then dive"

**Turn-taking** (if applicable): Take turns searching for different toys; everyone has a chance to be "first diver"

#### Free Exploration (1-2 minutes)

Let child experiment with diving, breath holding, and water exploration at their own pace
- Encourage trying movements they felt confident with
- Allow observation time without pressure
- Support them in playing with floating toys

### Cool-Down (1-2 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually exit water, warm body, transition to rest

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow walking in shallow water - "Walk slowly around, feeling calm"
2. Gentle floating or supported floating (if confident) - "Rest like a starfish"
3. Exit water and dry off with towel - "Wrap up in a warm towel"

**Transition**: "You did such a great job in the water today! Let's get warm and rest"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Focus on water comfort and face-touching rather than full submersion
- Use flotation devices liberally (water wings, noodles)
- Shorter active periods (5-8 minutes) with more rest breaks
- Adult should be in water providing physical support
- Emphasize play over diving technique
- Allow child to control depth and duration of head submersion
- Use very shallow water (ankle to knee depth)

**Duration**: 8-10 minutes total

**Adult support**: Physical support in water, hands-on guidance, constant verbal reassurance and encouragement

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Deeper water (chest height when standing)
- Full submersion with eyes open
- Coordinated diving motions with body control
- Longer breath-holding periods
- Retrieving objects from bottom of shallow area
- Introduction to flutter kicks while diving
- More complex games with multiple steps

**Duration**: Can extend to 15-18 minutes with more active diving rounds

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**: "You're so brave putting your face in the water! I love how you're blowing bubbles. Look at you diving like a real swimmer!"
- **What to avoid**: Don't force head under water; don't mock children who are afraid; avoid power-based encouragement ("be tough")
- **When to help**: Provide physical support during initial attempts, guide them under with hand on back, but allow them to emerge when ready

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is afraid to put face in water or hold breath
**Why**: Water in nose/eyes is uncomfortable; fear of drowning is natural; body's dive reflex can be startling
**Solution**: Practice breath-holding on dry land first, use goggles, let them control pace, shower face with water, be patient
**Timeline**: Most children overcome this within 3-5 sessions with consistent gentle exposure

**Challenge**: Child gets water in nose and coughs/cries
**Why**: The body's automatic response to water in nasal passages; unpleasant sensation triggers fear
**Solution**: Teach to blow out through nose, use a nose clip (if tolerated), practice on dryer land first
**Timeline**: Gets easier as they learn to control breathing; usually improves by age 4

**Challenge**: Child panics or freezes when submerged
**Why**: Loss of visual orientation, unpredictable sensations, or feeling of control loss trigger panic
**Solution**: Never force submersion, use shorter durations, practice with eye contact before diving, establish clear "come up" signals
**Timeline**: Most children who are not forced develop comfort by age 4

### Safety Reminders

- Water temperature should be 75-80 degrees F for children (not cold)
- Never ever leave child unattended in or near water - not even for seconds
- Always have adult within arm's reach of young children
- Use life jackets if child is not a confident swimmer
- Watch for signs of distress: struggling, silent panic, unusual behavior
- Keep drain safety in mind if in small tubs or spas
- Ensure no jumping from height into water without flotation
- Teach to never dive in water of unknown depth
- Establish "listen immediately" water safety rules

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Puts face in water voluntarily and without fear
- Holds breath for increasingly longer periods
- Opens eyes underwater and can see objects
- Performs simple duck dive or forward roll
- Retrieves toys from shallow bottom
- Shows increased confidence and willingness to try new movements
- Demonstrates proper breath control between dives

**When to add challenge**: When child confidently submerges full head and retrieves objects from shallow water, introduce coordinated diving strokes or deeper water activities
