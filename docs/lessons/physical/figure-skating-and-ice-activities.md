# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Figure Skating and Ice Activities

## Activity Summary

Figure skating and ice activities introduce children to the unique challenges of movement on slippery surfaces while building balance, coordination, and confidence on ice. These activities develop core stability, leg strength, and spatial awareness in a cold-weather environment. Skating activities combine athletic skill with artistic expression, encouraging both physical development and creative movement exploration.

**Activity Type**: Winter sport and performance-based physical activity

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (including transitions and rest)

**Energy Level**: Moderate to High

**Best Environment**: Ice skating rink, frozen pond/lake (safely prepared), outdoor ice area with supervision

**Space Required**: Ice skating surface (minimum 20x30 feet for beginner practice)

## Vocabulary

**Friction**: The resistance between two surfaces sliding against each other. Ice has one of the lowest friction coefficients of any natural surface — about 0.003 (rubber on dry concrete is 0.7) — because a thin liquid-like layer forms on ice near freezing temperatures, allowing skate blades to glide across it with almost no resistance. This is why stopping on ice is so much harder than stopping on grass.

**Center of gravity**: The single point through which a body's entire weight effectively acts — the balance point. Bending your knees lowers your center of gravity closer to the ice, making you much harder to tip over. Racing cars are wide and extremely low to the ground for exactly the same reason: a lower center of gravity means more stability.

**Momentum**: Mass multiplied by velocity — a measure of how much "motion" an object carries. A moving skater keeps sliding because momentum resists change (Newton's First Law), and with ice's tiny friction coefficient, almost nothing slows them down naturally. Stopping requires either friction with the ice edge, or gradually absorbing your own momentum by bending into a stop.

**Blade edge**: The narrow steel bottom of an ice skate — only a few millimeters wide. By concentrating your entire body weight on this thin strip, you can grip one edge of the blade to steer while gliding on another. Figure skates have a concave hollow ground between two edges, allowing skaters to engage an inside or outside edge for turns and jumps.

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Properly fitted ice skates (appropriate size and ankle support) - must fit correctly
- Helmet meeting safety standards - for head protection
- Thick winter clothing (layers) - to stay warm
- Padded gloves or mittens - for warmth and minor fall protection
- Warm socks (non-cotton preferred) - moisture-wicking
- Slip-resistant jacket and pants - for insulation

**Optional enhancements**:
- Wrist guards or padded wrist protectors - to prevent falling injuries
- Knee pads - additional fall protection
- Skating cones or markers - to define practice areas
- Skating push toys or walkers - stability aids for beginning skaters
- Music player - for artistic movement practice
- Camera - to record progress and celebrate improvements

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use regular winter clothes instead of specialized gear (less ideal but functional)
- Create makeshift skating aids from sturdy chairs or weighted toys
- Use household items as markers instead of cones
- Practice on prepared outdoor ice instead of paying for rink time

**Cost estimate**: $30-100 for rental or purchase of skates, helmet, and protective gear (if not already owned)

**Safety equipment**:
- Helmet is ESSENTIAL and non-negotiable
- Wrist guards recommended
- Padding on knees and elbows strongly suggested
- Proper skate fitting critical for safety and comfort

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Confirm ice surface is safe, smooth, and properly prepared
2. Clear ice of snow, debris, or hazards
3. Ensure adequate open space away from walls or obstacles
4. Verify helmet and skate fit is secure for each child
5. Establish warm-up area (off ice) for movement preparation
6. Set up resting and warming area nearby
7. Have water and towels accessible

**Boundaries**:
- Clear visual boundaries marking practice area
- Marked sections for different skill levels
- Safe exit area away from active skating zone
- Designated adult supervision position with full visibility

**Safety considerations**:
- Helmet MUST be worn at all times on ice - non-negotiable
- Ice temperature must be below freezing and surface solid
- No unsupervised skating - always within arm's reach or immediate sight
- Protective padding strongly recommended
- Proper skate fitting prevents ankle injuries
- One adult per 2-3 children on ice minimum
- Check skates for damage before each use
- Prevent hypothermia with frequent warm-up breaks indoors
- Watch for signs of cold injury: numbness, pale skin, shivering

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare muscles and joints for movement on ice, build focus and confidence, establish safety awareness

**Warm-up activities** (OFF ICE):
1. Walking, marching, and light jogging in place - "Get your body warm before we step on the ice"
2. Arm circles, shoulder rolls, and torso twists - "Loosen up all your joints"
3. Leg lifts and knee bends - "Wake up your legs for skating"

**Warm-up cues**:
- "We're getting our bodies warm and ready to be safe on ice"
- "Move your arms and legs to feel the warmth in your body"
- "Remember - you're wearing your helmet to keep your head safe!"

### Main Activity (12-20 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- Explain that ice is one of the slipperiest surfaces on Earth — the friction between the blade and ice is nearly zero, which is why we glide so easily but also why stopping takes practice
- Explain the skating stance: "Bending your knees lowers your center of gravity — your balance point — making you much harder to tip over. Straightening up raises it and makes you wobbly"
- Show proper skating stance: knees significantly bent, arms out for balance, eyes forward
- Demonstrate slow, controlled gliding movement
- Model falling safely: bend knees, lean forward, protect head with hands

#### Skill Practice (4-8 minutes)

**Balance and stance skill breakdown**:
- Posture: slight forward lean, knees bent for control, arms out to sides
- Weight distribution: keep weight balanced over feet
- Looking ahead: always watch where you're going
- Slow movement: glide gently, don't try to go fast yet

**Gliding and movement skill breakdown**:
- Pushing off: gentle push from one blade
- Gliding: coast smoothly on the ice
- Stopping: controlled slowdown, don't force stop
- Directional change: small angle turns, not sharp turns

**Creative expression skill breakdown**:
- Adding arm movements to skating
- Swaying and gentle spins
- Moving to music or rhythm
- Creating your own skating pattern

**Coaching cues**:
- "Keep your knees bent — bending low brings your center of gravity down, so you're much more stable"
- "Hold your arms out like you're balancing on a tightrope — they're your counterweights"
- "Look ahead, not down at your feet"
- "Let the friction of your blade edge slow you — don't force a stop all at once, that's when you fall"
- "Remember: ice has almost no friction, so your momentum keeps carrying you — plan your stops early"
- "You're doing great - you're in control!"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-10 minutes)

**Game structure**: Progress from holding support to independent skating to creative movement

**Beginning skaters (need support)**:
- Skating with hand hold from adult - gliding slowly together
- Skating alongside wall or rail - supporting self with hand
- Skating with push toy or walking frame - for stability
- "Follow the leader" at very slow pace - copying simple movements

**Intermediate skaters (more independent)**:
- Skating in marked lane - staying in designated area
- Skating around cones or markers - practicing directional changes
- "Simon says" with skating moves - following verbal cues
- Gentle partner skating - holding hands with another skater

**Advanced activities (longer skating)**:
- Skating longer distances - building confidence in movement
- Adding arm movements - combining balance with expression
- Creating skating patterns - moving creatively on ice
- Trying gentle spins - controlled rotation

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Helmet stays on your head the entire time
2. Skate slowly and under control
3. If you fall, that's okay - get help getting up
4. Stay in your marked area

**Variations**:
- For younger/less experienced: more hand-holding, shorter distances, adult directly beside
- For older/more experienced: longer distances, creative movements, partner activities
- Music-based skating: move to rhythm or follow musical patterns
- Obstacle navigation: gentle skating around and between cones
- Stopping practice: safe ways to slow down and stop

**Turn-taking**:
- All children can skate simultaneously in marked areas
- If space is limited, rotate groups on/off ice with short 2-3 minute turns
- Waiting groups can do warm-up exercises or watch and learn

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

Let children experiment with movements on ice:
- Practice their own gliding patterns
- Try adding arm movements they invented
- Move at their comfortable speed
- Build confidence through independent exploration

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually reduce intensity, transition off ice safely, begin warming process

**Cool-down activities** (transitions from ice):
1. Very slow gliding on ice - "Let's slow down our skating"
2. Careful exit from ice with hand support if needed - safety first
3. Gentle walking and stretching off ice - "Let's warm up away from the ice"

**Transition**:
- "We did wonderful skating today - you were so brave!"
- "Let's go inside where it's warm and rest our bodies"
- "Who wants hot chocolate?"

## Age Adaptations

- Avoid overconfidence and going too fast
- Teach safe falling techniques before independent skating
- Clear ice of snow and hazards

### Hypothermia and Cold Safety
- Session limit: 30 minutes continuous on ice
- Frequent breaks in warm environment (minimum every 15 minutes)
- Watch for excessive shivering, pale skin, or loss of coordination
- Require hand warmth checks - are extremities warm?
- Provide warm beverages after skating
- Change out of wet clothing promptly
- Bundle in layers that can be removed as needed

### When to Modify or Stop
- Child shows signs of cold: excessive shivering, numbness, pale skin
- Fatigue is obvious: stumbling, difficulty focusing
- Child expresses fear, anxiety, or refusal to participate
- Any sign of injury: falls that hurt, twisted ankle, hit head
- Visible ice hazards: cracks, thin spots, debris
- Temperature drops below safe range (consult local ice safety guidelines)

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

**What to say**:
- "You're so brave being out on the ice!"
- "Look how you're gliding - you're really skating!"
- "That took courage - I'm proud of you"
- "It's okay to fall - everyone does. Let's get you up and try again"
- "You're stronger and braver each time we come"

**What to avoid**:
- Pushing beyond comfort level ("Just try once more")
- Comparing to other skaters ("See how she goes faster?")
- Rushing progression ("You should be able to skate alone by now")
- Expressing frustration with slow progress
- Minimizing fear ("It's not that cold/scary")

**When to help**:
- Always be available for hand-holding initially
- Offer support when child appears unstable
- Help child up after falls - don't make them struggle
- Provide encouragement when afraid
- Step back gradually as confidence builds

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is afraid of ice and refuses to participate
**Why**: Ice feels unstable and alien; fear of falling is natural and healthy
**Solution**: Start by walking on ice fully clothed without skating; spend time just getting comfortable; offer constant hand support; never force participation; celebrate any attempt
**Timeline**: Fear typically decreases significantly within 3-5 sessions with patient, supportive approach

**Challenge**: Child falls frequently and becomes upset or discouraged
**Why**: Normal learning process; balance on ice is genuinely difficult; falling feels scary
**Solution**: Teach safe falling techniques; normalize falling ("Everyone falls"); provide extra padding; demonstrate that falls are okay; celebrate attempts not just successes
**Timeline**: Balance improves noticeably weeks 2-3 of regular practice

**Challenge**: Child gets very cold and wants to quit
**Why**: Extremities cool quickly; may not communicate discomfort clearly; tolerance for cold is lower
**Solution**: Limit sessions to 15-20 minutes; take frequent indoor warm-up breaks; check hands/feet regularly; provide warm drinks; allow rest inside with warm clothing
**Timeline**: Children develop better cold tolerance with repeated exposure

**Challenge**: Skating progression is slow and child becomes frustrated
**Why**: Ice skating has steep initial learning curve; 2-4 year olds have limited endurance and focus
**Solution**: Adjust expectations - this is genuinely hard skill; celebrate small progress; compare to their own previous sessions, not other skaters; consider whether this is right activity for child's age
**Timeline**: Meaningful progress typically visible weeks 3-4; skating proficiency takes months

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Increased confidence on ice with less adult support needed
- Longer periods without falling
- Able to glide for several feet independently
- Can stand and walk on ice without excessive wobbling
