# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Figure Skating and Ice Dance

## Activity Summary

Figure skating introduces children to graceful movement, balance, and artistic expression on ice. It also introduces real physics: why ice is slippery, how blade edges work, and why spinning skaters speed up when they pull their arms in (angular momentum). The sport's name comes from its origins — skaters were originally judged on the precision of the geometric *figures* they traced on the ice with their blades. Ice skating is one of humanity's oldest sports, with bone-blade skates found dating back 4,000 years.

**Activity Type**: Mind-body practice / Performance arts

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (including warm-up, practice, and cool-down)

**Energy Level**: Moderate to High

**Best Environment**: Ice rink with proper surface

**Space Required**: Open ice area (minimum 50x25 feet)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Child-sized figure skating skates (properly fitted and sharpened)
- Helmet (safety critical)
- Skating jacket or warm layer on top
- Skating tights or warm leggings
- Warm layers underneath
- Thick wool socks
- Gloves (optional, many skaters prefer bare hands)
- Hair tie if long hair (for clear sight lines)

**Optional enhancements**:
- Music player (helps with rhythm and movement)
- Colorful skating skirt or costume (encourages artistry)
- Neck warmer/gaiter
- Hand warmers
- Ribbon for balance work
- Mirrors (to see form)

**DIY alternatives**:
- Practice movement patterns on smooth floor or carpet indoors
- Use roller skates on smooth pavement (introduces similar balance concepts)
- Dance on floor to music meant for ice dancing

**Cost estimate**: $40-80 for skate rental; $100-200+ for purchase of used child skates; lessons $40-100/hour

**Safety equipment**: Helmet is essential; some facilities require wrist guards or padded shorts

## Key Vocabulary

**Blade edge**: A skate blade has two edges — inside and outside — separated by a hollow groove. Skaters never skate flat on the blade; they skate on one edge or the other. Edges allow turns and curving glides that would be impossible on a flat blade.

**Angular momentum**: The physics of spinning. When a skater pulls their arms close to their body, they spin faster — without any extra push. This is conservation of angular momentum: as the mass moves closer to the axis of rotation, rotation speed increases. You can feel this in a spinning chair.

**Why ice is slippery**: The surface of ice is always slightly different from the solid bulk below — the outermost molecules aren't as locked in place and behave more like a thin liquid layer. Pressure from a skate blade (and friction generating heat) enhances this effect, creating a lubricating film that allows gliding.

**Compulsory figures**: The original meaning of "figure skating." Skaters used to trace precise geometric patterns — circles, figure-8s — on the ice with their blades and be judged on the accuracy of the tracings. This discipline was dropped from Olympic competition in 1990, but it's where the sport's name comes from.

**Arabesque / spiral**: A skating position where one leg extends behind the body while the skater glides on the other — borrowed directly from ballet vocabulary.

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Ensure ice surface is smooth and well-maintained
2. Clear practice area of other skaters and obstacles
3. Establish designated practice zone
4. Have barriers or walls available for balance support
5. Position mirrors if possible (helps with form awareness)
6. Check temperature - ice skating environment is cold

**Boundaries**:
- Use boards or cones to create a practice area
- Keep near walls or boards for balance support initially
- Avoid crowded times at public skating rinks
- Mark performance or routine areas if practicing choreography

**Safety considerations**:
- Falls on hard ice - proper helmet use; teach correct falling technique; padded clothing helps
- Loss of balance - ice is slippery; young children feel unsafe; support and props help
- Collision with other skaters - enforce spacing and controlled movement
- Cold exposure - ice environment is extremely cold; monitor for hypothermia
- Ankle injuries - skating boots support ankles, but turns and spins increase injury risk
- Overuse injuries - young children shouldn't repeat difficult movements excessively
- Getting lost on ice - some young children disoriented on large ice surfaces
- Exhaustion - figure skating is energetically demanding; frequent breaks needed

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare muscles for activity, increase body temperature, and establish comfort on ice before learning movements

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Marching on ice - activate muscles and establish balance
2. Arm circles and shoulder rolls - prepare upper body
3. Gentle swaying motions - feel rhythm and music (if using)

**Warm-up cues**: "Let's march around like we own this ice! Now swing your arms like you're dancing! Feel the rhythm - we're going to make beautiful movements today!"

### Main Activity (15-25 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2-3 minutes)
- Say: "Did you know ice skating is 4,000 years old? The first skates were made from animal bones. And 'figure skating' gets its name from drawing geometric figures — circles and figure-8s — on the ice with the blade. Skaters used to be judged on how perfectly shaped the figures were."
- Show the blade and point out the groove: "There are two edges on this blade. Skaters use their edges to curve and turn — you're never skating flat."
- Show basic movements: gliding, gentle turns, the arabesque position
- Key physics point: "Watch what happens when I pull my arms in while spinning — I go faster. That's called angular momentum."

#### Skill Practice (5-10 minutes)
**Skill breakdown**:
- **Gliding balance**: Practice pushing off and gliding smoothly; feel weight distribution
- **Forward and backward movement**: Develop ability to move in different directions with control
- **Simple turns**: Practice small, gentle turns that begin to change direction

**Coaching cues**:
- "Feel which edge you're on — inside or outside? Try to feel the difference."
- "Keep your arms out for balance. What happens to your spin when you pull them in?"
- "Why does the ice let you glide? There's always a tiny bit of slippery surface right on top."

#### Guided Play/Game (8-10 minutes)
**Game structure**:

1. **Graceful Gliding**: Child and adult skate together, moving to imaginary music; focus on smooth, flowing motion
2. **Shape Making**: Child creates different shapes with their body while skating (tall, wide, curled up) - develops body awareness
3. **Follow the Leader**: Adult demonstrates simple movements and sequences; child mirrors movements on ice
4. **Storytelling Skating**: Create simple story (butterfly, fairy, dancer) and move on ice in character
5. **Music and Movement**: Play simple, rhythmic music; child skates and moves expressively to the beat

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Move gracefully and carefully on ice
2. Look ahead to see where you're going
3. Hold the boards for balance when needed
4. Tell an adult if you're tired

**Variations**:
- Variation 1: Start with floor-based movement patterns before moving to ice
- Variation 2: Introduce partner skating - child and adult hold hands and skate together
- Variation 3: Focus on basic skating skills before adding artistic expression

**Turn-taking**: If multiple children, create small performance areas or take turns with music

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)
Allow child to explore movement independently with supervision
- What to encourage: Experimentation with different movements; expressing feelings through motion; building confidence
- When to observe: Watch for fatigue or cold; allow child to discover their own movement patterns

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually lower intensity, transition from activity, and celebrate effort

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow skating - gentle, rhythmic movement
2. Standing stretch - hamstrings and hip flexors while on ice or after exiting
3. Breathing exercises - calm the nervous system

**Transition**: Exit ice, remove skates, change into dry warm clothes, discussion of what movements were most fun

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Modifications**:
- Focus entirely on basic skating before any choreography or artistry
- Very short sessions (10-15 minutes maximum)
- One adult per child with constant support or very close supervision
- Use rink boards for balance support - child may hold boards while skating
- Expect frequent falls and need for reassurance
- Keep movements very simple - only forward/backward gliding
- Skip any turning, spins, or fancy footwork
- Goal is comfort and confidence on ice
- Artistic expression comes later - skill foundation is priority

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes total

**Adult support**: Hands-on support when needed - holding hands, steadying from behind, helping child stand up after falls

### 3-4+ years
**Challenges to add**:
- Develop more confident gliding with less support
- Introduce gentle turns and directional changes
- Add simple arm movements coordinated with skating
- Begin moving to music
- Learn simple positions (like arabesque - single leg extended)
- Practice sequences of movements
- Increase duration and complexity of skating
- Add playful elements like pretending to be animals or dancers

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes for experienced skaters

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips
- **What to say**: "You moved so gracefully!" or "I loved how you glided across the ice - you looked like a real figure skater!"
- **What to avoid**: "Don't fall" (creates tension); focusing on mistakes rather than effort; pressure to perform
- **When to help**: Provide support when requested; observe more than correct; celebrate brave attempts at new movements

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is afraid of falling or feels unstable on ice
**Why**: Ice is unpredictable; young children haven't developed skating-specific balance; past falls create anxiety
**Solution**: Use boards for balance support longer than expected; hold child's hand initially; practice falling safely on padded floor first; use humor ("That's how skaters learn - by trying!"); allow child to progress at their own pace
**Timeline**: Confidence typically increases within 3-5 sessions as child experiences safe skating

**Challenge**: Child loses interest or gets frustrated with repetitive practice
**Why**: Young children need variety and play; formal practice feels boring and rigid
**Solution**: Turn practice into games and storytelling; change activities every 2-3 minutes; use music to make it fun; incorporate imaginative play (skating like animals); keep sessions shorter; make achievements feel celebratory
**Timeline**: Interest increases when practice feels like play rather than work

**Challenge**: Child complains of sore feet or ankles after skating
**Why**: Skating boots are tight for control; muscles working differently than land-based activities; young feet are still developing
**Solution**: Ensure proper skate fit - this is crucial; take frequent breaks; limit initial session length; check for any pressure points in skates; build tolerance gradually; stretch feet after skating
**Timeline**: Discomfort usually decreases as child acclimates to equipment and muscles strengthen

**Challenge**: Child wants to do advanced movements (spins, jumps) before ready
**Why**: Young children see older skaters and want to imitate immediately; lack understanding of prerequisite skills
**Solution**: Focus on foundational skills first; explain "we need strong legs before we spin"; break down movements into smaller components; celebrate progress in current skills; set appropriate challenges
**Timeline**: Most children not ready for jumps until age 7+; spins around age 5-6 if trained

### Safety Reminders
- Always wear a helmet - young children fall frequently while learning
- Ensure proper skate fit - too tight causes discomfort, too loose affects control
- Supervise closely on ice - young children can become disoriented
- Keep sessions shorter initially - build up to longer times
- Watch for signs of cold - take indoor breaks every 15-20 minutes
- Stop immediately if child is upset or in pain
- Don't push child to progress faster than comfortable
- Avoid jumping or spinning until properly trained - risk of ankle/leg injury
- Practice falling safely before starting ice sessions

### Progress Tracking
**Signs of skill development**:
- Can stand and move in skates with reduced support
- Can glide forward and backward with control
- Can make gentle turns while maintaining balance
- Moves with increased smoothness and fewer interruptions
- Shows less fear of falling and stands up quickly
- Can sustain movement for longer periods
- Demonstrates understanding of rhythm and music
- Shows willingness to try new movements

**When to add challenge**:
- When child can skate confidently for extended periods
- After 5-10 sessions on ice with comfort
- When child is moving smoothly without frequent loss of balance
- When child requests or shows interest in new movements
- When fear and frustration are no longer dominant emotions
- When child can follow simple sequences of movements
