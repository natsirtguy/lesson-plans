# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Hockey (Ice and Field)

## Activity Summary

Hockey introduces young children to stick handling, coordination, and basic team concepts through fun, age-appropriate games. Whether played on grass with plastic sticks or imagined on ice, hockey develops gross motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and spatial awareness while building confidence in a playful setting. This activity teaches children how to control equipment, follow simple strategies, and enjoy movement with peers.

**Activity Type**: Team Sport / Motor Skill Development

## Vocabulary

**Stick handling**: The skill of controlling the puck or ball with your stick while moving. Real hockey players practice stick handling thousands of times until it becomes automatic — they don't need to look at the puck because their hands "know" where it is. This is called *proprioception*: your body's ability to sense where its own parts are without looking.

**Dribbling**: In field hockey, moving the ball forward with small, controlled taps of the stick while running. Each tap is a moment of contact, then release, then contact again. This is harder than it sounds because you have to coordinate your feet, eyes, and stick all at once — a classic multi-limb coordination challenge.

**Friction**: The force that slows things down when they slide across a surface. This is why ice hockey and field hockey feel completely different: ice has almost no friction (a puck can slide 100 feet), while grass has high friction (a ball slows quickly and must be actively pushed). Ice players use metal blades that create a thin film of water, reducing friction further.

**Center of gravity**: The point where an object's weight is balanced in all directions. Hockey players crouch low to lower their center of gravity, which makes them more stable and harder to knock over. Stand straight and someone can push you over easily; crouch and bend your knees, and you're much more stable. This is basic physics applied to the human body.

**Ice hockey vs. field hockey**: Two different sports using the same basic concept — a stick and a goal — but with key differences. *Ice hockey* uses a hard rubber puck (a flat disk) on a frozen ice surface; players wear skates and can move extremely fast. *Field hockey* uses a round ball on grass; the stick is curved and players hit the ball with only the flat side. Field hockey is one of the world's oldest team sports, played for over 4,000 years.

**Duration**: 12-20 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: High

**Best Environment**: Outdoor open space / Large gymnasium / Backyard

**Space Required**: Large open area (at least 30x20 feet minimum)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Plastic sticks or lightweight hockey sticks - age-appropriate length (18-28 inches depending on child height)
- Soft puck or ball - foam, plastic, or lightweight (4-6 inches diameter)
- Cones or markers - to define goals and boundaries
- Small goal or target - can be two cones spaced 3-4 feet apart

**Optional enhancements**:
- Lightweight helmets or headgear - adds safety and increases engagement
- Colored pinnies or arm bands - helps identify teams
- Small foam balls in different colors - variety keeps activity fresh
- Stick tape - helps maintain grip on handles

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use paper towel tubes or wrapping paper tubes as sticks
- Make a ball from rolled-up socks or newspaper
- Use rolled towels or jump ropes as goal markers
- Create goals with chairs or cardboard boxes

**Cost estimate**: Free (household items) to Under $20

**Safety equipment**:
- Non-slip footwear required
- Clear playing space with no sharp objects
- Consider soft shin guards for older 3-4+ year olds

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear the play area of obstacles, furniture, and hazards
2. Ensure soft, even ground (grass or gym floor is ideal)
3. Set up two small goals at opposite ends of a 20-30 foot play area
4. Mark boundaries with cones or tape so children know the play zone
5. Have water available nearby for hydration breaks

**Boundaries**:
- Use cones, chalk lines, or tape to mark a rectangular play area
- Make boundaries visible and easy to understand
- Goals should be clearly marked at each end

**Safety considerations**:
- Ensure no one stands directly behind or in front of players with sticks
- Teach children to always keep sticks below shoulder height
- Check that play area is free of trip hazards
- Supervise closely to prevent stick contact with faces
- Establish a "sticks down" signal for stopping play immediately
- Never allow running with sticks pointed at others

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Get bodies moving, prepare muscles for activity, build excitement for hockey play

**Warm-up activities**:
1. **Walking in different ways** - Walk forward, backward, sideways, tiptoe around the play area. Narrate: "Let's walk like penguins waddling to the ice rink!"
2. **Gentle arm circles** - Circle arms in both directions. Say: "Make big windmills with your arms, just like hockey players warming up!"
3. **High knees march** - March in place lifting knees high. Encourage: "Lift those knees up high! We're getting ready to skate!"

**Warm-up cues**:
- "Wiggle your whole body like you're shaking off the cold!"
- "Let's get warm before we play hockey!"
- "Move around the space - no bumping into friends!"

### Main Activity (10-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- Show children the hockey stick and soft puck/ball. Ask: "Why is a hockey stick curved at the bottom? So you can push and control the ball while standing upright — if it were straight, you'd have to bend down to reach the ball."
- Demonstrate how to hold the stick with both hands (like holding a broom). Explain: "Hockey players crouch down low — like this. Your body is more stable when you're low. Try to push me over when I'm standing straight (gentle push). Now try when I'm crouched! Much harder — that's your center of gravity."
- Model a gentle stick-ball contact (don't need to hit hard)
- Explain the ice vs. field difference: "Today we're playing field hockey — on grass or the floor. Ice hockey players use skates and go much faster because ice has almost no friction. Feel the floor — it has *more* friction, so our ball slows down faster."

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)
**Skill breakdown**:
1. **Stick handling** - Hold stick with both hands near the bottom, keep it on the ground, gently guide the ball forward
2. **Basic push/tap** - Lightly tap the ball with the stick end to move it
3. **Coordination** - Move the stick and feet together so the ball goes where you want it to go

**Coaching cues**:
- "Hold the stick like you're holding a broom handle"
- "Gently push the ball - we're not trying to hit it hard"
- "Keep your eyes on the ball as your stick touches it"
- "Walk with the ball - your feet help you control it"
- "You're doing great! Keep practicing!"

#### Guided Play/Game (5-8 minutes)
**Game structure**:
- Simple "Kick the Puck" style game where children take turns pushing the puck toward a goal
- Alternatively, create two small teams (2-4 children per team) and play cooperative hockey where everyone tries to move the puck forward together
- For younger 2-3 year olds: Focus on individual skill practice with taking turns at goals

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Use the stick to push the ball - no hands allowed (except to hold the stick)
2. Keep the stick below shoulder height at all times
3. Walk with the ball - no running
4. When the ball goes toward the goal, everyone cheers!

**Variations**:
- **Relay races** - Children take turns pushing the ball to a line and back
- **Target practice** - Try to push the puck through different sized goals or targets
- **Obstacle course hockey** - Weave the puck around cones while pushing it with the stick
- **Team push** - Multiple children cooperatively push the puck toward a goal while staying close together

**Turn-taking** (if applicable):
- Use a simple rotation: each child gets a turn to push the puck toward the goal while others wait at a designated spot
- Make waiting active: have waiting children practice stick handling motions without the puck
- Cheer for each player - "Go [Name]! You can do it!"

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)
Let children experiment with the sticks and ball:
- Try different ways to move the puck
- Practice pushing with different parts of the stick
- Create their own games with the equipment
- Simply walk around the space with a stick, getting comfortable with how it feels

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Slow down heart rate, transition from active play to calm, wind down the energy

**Cool-down activities**:
1. **Slow walking** - Walk slowly around the space, breathing deeply. Say: "Breathe in slowly... breathe out slowly..."
2. **Gentle stretches** - Reach arms up to the sky, then down to toes (or as far as comfortable). Hold stick vertical for balance.
3. **Rest and chat** - Sit in a circle and talk about what they enjoyed about hockey. "What was your favorite part?"

**Transition**:
- Gradually reduce movement intensity
- Use calm, quiet voice
- Collect equipment together as a final calming activity
- Praise effort: "You all did such a wonderful job playing hockey today!"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Modifications**:
- Simplify stick holding - may need hand-over-hand guidance initially
- Use larger, softer pucks (foam balls) that are easier to move
- Keep play area smaller (15x15 feet)
- Focus on individual skill practice rather than team play
- Accept that children may pick up the puck with hands - gently redirect to stick
- Much more adult support and demonstration needed
- Keep activities to 8-10 minutes total, with more frequent breaks

**Duration**: 8-10 minutes active play

**Adult support**: High - expect to demonstrate frequently, guide hand positions, provide lots of encouragement and patience

### 3-4+ years
**Challenges to add**:
- Introduce simple scoring (count goals together)
- Play actual two-team games with simple rules
- Increase speed and distance of play
- Add directional skills: "Push it to the left," "Aim for that goal"
- Introduce light competition in a fun, non-threatening way
- Try different stick sizes and weights
- Play longer continuous games (up to 15-20 minutes)

**Duration**: Can extend to 18-20 minutes with breaks

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips
- **What to say**: "You're learning to control the stick! That's fantastic!" or "Look how you moved the ball forward - great job!" or "It's okay if it's wobbly - that's how we learn!"
- **What to avoid**: Don't criticize technique ("You're holding it wrong") or make comparisons between children ("See how she does it better?")
- **When to help**: Offer hand-over-hand guidance when introducing stick handling, but let them try independently after a few demonstrations

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't let go of the puck/ball to use the stick
**Why**: At this age, hands are still their primary way of interacting with objects. Using tools feels unnatural initially.
**Solution**: Start by letting them hold both the puck and stick, then gradually practice "touching" the puck with the stick. Make it playful: "Let's tap it together!"
**Timeline**: Most 2-3 year olds improve with 3-4 weeks of practice; 3-4 year olds may grasp this within 1-2 weeks

**Challenge**: Child swings the stick too hard or holds it at shoulder height
**Why**: Young children don't understand force control and may copy what they've seen on TV without understanding safety
**Solution**: Demonstrate the proper height (stick should stay below waist) repeatedly. Use a "sticks down" stop signal. Praise when they hold it safely: "Yes! That's exactly where your stick should be!"
**Timeline**: Safety habits develop gradually; this needs reinforcement over multiple sessions

**Challenge**: Child loses interest or gets frustrated after a few minutes
**Why**: Young children have short attention spans and may feel discouraged if they can't control the equipment
**Solution**: Switch activities frequently, celebrate small successes, let them take breaks, and keep the focus on fun rather than skill mastery
**Timeline**: Attention span increases with age; expect improvements by 4+ years

**Challenge**: Child wants to play with the stick like a sword or wand instead of using it for hockey
**Why**: Imaginative play is developmentally appropriate at this age - they naturally want to explore what the object "is"
**Solution**: Validate the play ("Great pretend!") but gently redirect: "Let's also try using it like hockey players do." Balance structured hockey with creative stick play
**Timeline**: As children gain experience with hockey, they'll better understand its purpose

### Safety Reminders
- Always supervise closely when children have sticks - they can be unpredictable
- Establish and practice the "sticks down" signal for immediate stopping
- Never allow aggressive stick play or swinging
- Keep play area clear of other children who aren't actively playing
- Check that sticks are age-appropriate length (not too long or heavy)
- Ensure soft playing surface to minimize injury risk if children fall

### Progress Tracking
**Signs of skill development**:
- Child can hold stick with both hands and maintain grip
- Can gently contact the puck with the stick end
- Can walk while controlling the puck with the stick (within 2-3 weeks)
- Understands boundaries and basic rules (by 3+ years)
- Can take turns and wait for their turn with minimal frustration (develops over time)
- Can push puck toward a goal with some accuracy (by 4+ years)

**When to add challenge**:
- Once they can consistently move the puck, introduce targets or smaller goals
- When they understand basic rules, add light team play
- When they can play for 10+ minutes, introduce game variations
- When they show desire for competition, add simple scoring
