# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Kayaking and Paddling Sports

## Activity Summary

Kayaking and paddling sports introduce young children to water-based movement using paddles and small watercraft. This activity builds upper body strength, coordination, and water confidence while exploring aquatic environments. It develops core stability, arm coordination, and introduces children to water safety in a controlled, playful manner.

**Activity Type**: Aquatic sport

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes (including water entry and exit)

**Energy Level**: Moderate to High

**Best Environment**: Calm lake, pond, controlled water area, or swimming pool with paddling equipment

**Space Required**: Calm, shallow water area with gentle entry; 50+ feet of clear water space

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Child-sized kayak or paddling toy (2-4 feet long, stable design)
- Child-sized paddle or oar (lightweight, 3-4 feet long)
- U.S. Coast Guard-approved personal flotation device (PFD/life jacket) - properly fitted for child's weight
- Non-slip footwear (water shoes or sandals with straps)
- Towel for drying

**Optional enhancements**:
- Paddling toy that doesn't require balancing (sit-on-top kayak, inflatable raft)
- Waterproof bag for storing belongings
- Splash guard or skirt to keep water out (for older children)
- Paddle leash to prevent losing paddle in water
- Snorkel or goggles for water exploration (with supervision)
- Floating toys to chase or retrieve
- Water-safe markers for decorating kayak

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use pool noodles as paddling implements in shallow water
- Paddle with hands in inflatable pool raft or tube
- Use a sturdy board or plywood as a "kayak" in shallow water
- Create a paddling experience in a large plastic container or horse trough filled with water

**Cost estimate**: $30-100 (child kayak and paddle); life jacket $30-60; rental options typically $25-40/hour

**Safety equipment**:
- Coast Guard-approved life jacket (non-negotiable)
- First aid kit at water's edge
- Flotation rescue device within reach
- Whistle for emergency signals
- Appropriate clothing (water-resistant layer, not cotton)
- Sun protection (hat, sunscreen, rash guard)

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Choose calm water with no current, waves, or motor traffic
2. Verify depth: entry area should be knee-deep for caregiver (at least 2-3 feet to prevent paddle hitting bottom abruptly)
3. Clear water of debris, sharp objects, or hazards
4. Establish clear boundaries (weighted line, cones on shore, or natural landmarks)
5. Scout exit strategy: accessible shore with gentle slope, no slippery surfaces
6. Check weather: no strong winds, storms, or temperature extremes
7. Have helper caregiver stationed at water's edge if possible

**Boundaries**:
- Define paddling zone within 50-100 feet of shore
- Establish no-go zones (deeper water, docks, other water traffic)
- Use buoys, ropes, or shore markers to indicate limits
- Keep child within immediate visual contact at all times

**Safety considerations**:
- Never allow any water activity without properly fitted, Coast Guard-approved life jacket
- Avoid waters with currents, large waves, or motorized traffic
- Check water temperature; avoid cold water (below 60°F) without proper wetsuit
- Watch for sudden depth changes, underwater obstacles, or slippery surfaces
- Have clear protocol if child falls in (child practice exiting water in controlled way first)
- Ensure rescue equipment accessible and caregiver trained in water rescue basics
- Monitor for fatigue and hypothermia signs (shivering, loss of coordination)
- Never force a child into water if fearful; build water confidence gradually
- Establish clear "stop" signal if child feels unsafe or overwhelmed
- Ensure child can be reached easily; don't paddle in tandem boats without extreme caution

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare upper body and core for paddling; build confidence with equipment

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Land-based paddle practice: Hold paddle and make slow paddling motions while sitting - "Make the motion, but move the air"
2. Arm circles and shoulder rolls: "Let's wake up our shoulders and arms"
3. Gentle twisting: Rotate torso side to side while holding paddle - "Twist like a pretzel"

**Warm-up cues**: "We're getting our arms and shoulders ready to paddle like explorers!"

### Main Activity (10-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- Show proper grip: hands shoulder-width apart on paddle handle
- Demonstrate paddle entry and exit: "Dip in the water, pull backward, then lift out"
- Show basic forward stroke motion (can demonstrate in chair on shore or in kayak in shallow water)
- Explain that paddle helps the kayak move forward: "The water helps push us"

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
- **Paddling position**: Sitting upright with good posture; feet secure; knees slightly bent
- **Paddle grip**: Hands evenly spaced; relaxed but firm grip
- **Forward stroke**: Reach forward with paddle blade in water, rotate hips/core, pull back
- **Exit and recovery**: Lift paddle from water, rotate forward, ready for next stroke

**Coaching cues**:
- "Sit tall like a king or queen in your kayak"
- "Make big reach-backs with your paddle, like you're pulling water toward you"
- "One arm pushes, one arm pulls, then they switch"
- "Let your whole body help, not just your arms"
- "You're doing it! Keep those paddles moving!"

#### Guided Play/Game (5-8 minutes)

**Game structure**: Transform paddling into exploration and discovery

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Stay within marked boundaries
2. Keep life jacket fastened at all times
3. Call out when you see something interesting

**Variations**:
- **Paddle and explore**: Slowly paddle along shoreline identifying wildlife, plants, interesting rocks
- **Paddle to targets**: Place floating markers or buoys for child to paddle toward and around
- **Slow-motion paddle**: Challenge to paddle as slowly as possible without stopping
- **Forward and backward**: Practice paddling forward a few strokes, then backward
- **Water painting**: Dip paddle in water and make designs on the kayak deck
- **Sound paddle**: Listen to different sounds the paddle makes as they practice (splashes, water sounds)

**Turn-taking** (if applicable):
- If using one kayak, parent paddles with child as passenger, then child paddles while parent walks alongside in shallow water
- Use tandem kayak with adult in back controlling direction while child practices paddling
- Rotate child and caregiver positions

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

Let child experiment with paddling speed, direction changes, and paddle techniques in safe area.
- What to encourage: Trying different paddle speeds, exploring different water areas, calling out discoveries
- When to observe: Watch for signs of fatigue, frustration, or discomfort; offer rest breaks frequently

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Safely transition from active paddling; reflect on water adventure

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Float or drift quietly with minimal paddling - "Let your body rest while we listen to the water"
2. Gentle arm stretches while in kayak - reach across chest, rotate shoulders
3. Exit water slowly and carefully; sit together and discuss the adventure

**Transition**: "You were such an amazing paddler! Let's get dried off and rest."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Use inflatable raft, sit-on-top kayak, or paddling toy that prioritizes stability over technique
- Stay in very shallow water (knee-deep for caregiver); child may not paddle independently
- Focus on holding paddle, making splashing motions, and experiencing water movement
- Adult provides significant physical support and control of direction
- Very short sessions: 5-10 minutes maximum
- May be passenger while caregiver paddles slowly

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes of active water time

**Adult support**:
- Provide seat support and weight distribution assistance
- Control paddle and steering; child mimics motions
- Keep arms within reach at all times
- Manage mounting/dismounting; child needs significant help getting in and out
- Remain in water with child for safety and confidence

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Practice forward paddling with repeated strokes on both sides
- Introduce basic steering with uneven paddle strokes
- Navigate around floating obstacles or markers
- Paddle to specific targets at increasing distances
- Try directional paddling: forward, backward, and gentle turns
- Introduce paddle technique refinement (deeper reaches, smoother strokes)
- Short paddling "races" or challenges against timer
- Explore different water conditions (slightly moving water, areas with gentle waves)

**Duration**: Can extend to 20+ minutes with appropriate breaks

**Additional skills**:
- Independent balance and weight distribution in kayak
- Coordinated alternating paddling strokes
- Directional control and turning
- Awareness of water conditions and safety boundaries
- Confidence in water rescue (exiting capsized kayak in controlled setting)

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**:
  - "You're paddling so smoothly! Feel how your kayak moves?"
  - "Your arms are so strong!"
  - "Look at all the water you can explore now"
  - "You're being so brave and having fun!"
  - "Every paddler starts where you are; you're learning beautifully"

- **What to avoid**:
  - Don't express anxiety about water ("Watch out for deep water!"); it creates fear
  - Don't force paddling; let child paddle at their own pace
  - Don't compare to other children or siblings
  - Don't overestimate child's water comfort or stamina

- **When to help**:
  - Support during entry and exit until confident and independent
  - Provide gentle guidance on paddle angle and stroke technique
  - Offer physical support if child loses balance but doesn't tip
  - Intervene immediately if child shows fatigue, cold, or panic

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is afraid of water or doesn't want to paddle
**Why**: Water is unfamiliar; loss of solid ground creates anxiety; previous frightening experiences with water
**Solution**: Start in extremely shallow water with just paddle splashing; practice mounting/dismounting on shore; have child pour water on themselves to adjust to sensation; use flotation toys and playful activities
**Timeline**: Water comfort builds gradually with repeated positive experiences over weeks and months

**Challenge**: Child can't coordinate paddling on both sides; only paddles one way
**Why**: Bilateral coordination is still developing; focusing on one side is easier cognitively
**Solution**: Practice paddling one side repeatedly before introducing alternating; use verbal cues ("Paddle, paddle, paddle, switch"); make it a game with rhythm or song
**Timeline**: Alternating strokes develop around age 4-5 with practice

**Challenge**: Child paddles but kayak doesn't move forward efficiently
**Why**: Paddle angle is wrong (too shallow or deep); paddle recovery is slow; child lacks power or coordination
**Solution**: Demonstrate paddle angle; help guide first few strokes; focus on one good stroke at a time rather than speed; build strength gradually
**Timeline**: Efficient paddling improves with practice over several weeks

**Challenge**: Child gets cold quickly or has difficulty staying warm
**Why**: Young children lose body heat faster than adults; water temperature is cool; child is thin
**Solution**: Limit water time in cold water; use rash guard or light wetsuit; take frequent breaks; watch for shivering or lethargy; choose warmer water or wait for warmer weather
**Timeline**: Cold tolerance improves with age and practice; always prioritize warmth

### Safety Reminders

- Life jacket must be worn at all times in and around water; make it as normal as a helmet on a bike
- Never leave child unattended or out of immediate reach during water activities
- Know basic water rescue techniques and keep rescue equipment accessible
- Check weather and water conditions before every outing
- Establish clear signals for "stop" and "help me" before paddling
- Ensure child can exit kayak and tread water or reach shallow ground if vessel tips
- Avoid water that is too cold, too deep, too murky, or has hazards
- End session immediately if child shows signs of cold, exhaustion, fear, or discomfort
- Practice land-based safety skills (falling, getting up, calling for help) before water activities

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Holds paddle with proper grip and maintains it during paddling
- Makes forward paddling strokes on both sides with improving coordination
- Kayak moves noticeably forward in response to paddling
- Stays in kayak without excessive tilting or instability
- Shows decreasing anxiety and increasing enthusiasm for water time
- Can paddle in straight line or gentle curves within paddling zone

**Progression over weeks/months**:
- Week 1-2: Getting comfortable entering kayak and holding paddle
- Week 3-4: Making paddling motions and kayak moving slowly forward
- Week 5-8: Coordinating multiple strokes and maintaining direction
- Month 3+: Independent paddling with steering control and confidence

**When to add challenge**:
- Child paddles continuously for 10+ minutes without fatigue
- Demonstrates coordinated alternating strokes
- Can navigate around obstacles or toward targets
- Shows no fear and requests longer paddling sessions
- Ready to explore different water conditions or longer distances
