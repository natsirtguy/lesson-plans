# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Lacrosse and Stick Sports

## Activity Summary

Lacrosse and stick sports for young learners focus on developing hand-eye coordination, gross motor control, and cooperative play through adapted stick handling and gentle striking activities. Rather than the complex rules of traditional lacrosse, young children ages 2-4 engage in simplified stick manipulation, rolling and pushing soft objects with sticks, and basic team cooperation games. This activity builds confidence with equipment, develops bilateral coordination, and introduces the joy of team-based play.

**Activity Type**: Team Sport / Motor Skill Development

**Duration**: 12-18 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Moderate to High

**Best Environment**: Outdoor open space / Large gymnasium / Backyard

**Space Required**: Large open area (20x20 feet minimum)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Foam or plastic sticks (18-24 inches long, very light weight) - 4-6 sticks total
- Soft foam balls (4-6 inches diameter) or yarn balls - 2-3 balls
- Cones or soft markers - 4-6 for boundaries and goals
- Low-level nets or rope stretched between cones at child height (18-24 inches) - optional

**Optional enhancements**:
- Colorful foam pool noodles (can substitute for sticks - easier to control)
- Lightweight plastic buckets as "goals"
- Soft yarn balls in different colors
- Small foam hockey pucks
- Child-sized helmets or soft headgear (for confidence, not required)

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use pool noodles cut in half as lightweight sticks
- Make yarn balls from old yarn or newspaper
- Use plastic cups or buckets as goals
- Create boundaries with rope, tape, or natural features (trees, bushes)
- Use rolled-up newspaper and newspaper balls as substitutes

**Cost estimate**: Free to $15 (if sourcing specialty foam sticks and balls)

**Safety equipment**:
- Clear goggles optional (to protect eyes)
- Soft padding on stick ends if using harder plastic sticks

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear a large flat area free of obstacles, rocks, and hazards
2. Mark two goal areas at opposite ends using cones (can be 10-15 feet apart for 2-3 year olds)
3. Place all equipment in the center so children can see what's available
4. Check the ground for safety (no holes, loose rocks, or debris)

**Boundaries**: Use cones, rope, or natural landmarks to create a rectangular play area. For very young children, make the space smaller (15x15 feet).

**Safety considerations**:
- No stick swinging above shoulder height - enforce a "low stick" rule
- Maintain clear sight lines - no children behind the action
- Keep sticks away from faces and eyes - supervise closely
- Establish a "drop the stick" signal if play becomes unsafe
- Ensure adequate spacing between children (at least 6 feet during play)
- Check all equipment for splinters, sharp edges, or loose pieces before use

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare the body for stick handling, increase heart rate gently, and build excitement about the activity

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Gentle stick marching - children hold their sticks and march around the space, lifting knees high
2. Stick circles - standing in place, children hold the stick horizontally and make small circles in front of them
3. Walking with the stick - children carry their stick while walking, then jogging lightly around the play area

**Warm-up cues**: "Let's wake up our arms and legs! Hold your stick like it's a magic wand and march with me. Now let's make big circles in the air with our stick. Great! Now we're going to trot around our play space with our stick."

### Main Activity (8-12 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Introduce the stick: "This is our special sports stick. We're going to learn how to use it to move balls around like the big players do!"
- Demonstrate how to hold the stick (both hands, loose grip, at waist level)
- Demonstrate the basic movement: pushing a soft ball along the ground with the stick
- Show that sticks stay low (waist height or below)

**Key coaching point**: "Sticks stay LOW - we're not swinging them high. We're pushing the ball gently with our stick."

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
- **Grip and hold**: Both hands on the stick, relaxed grip, elbows slightly bent
- **Pushing motion**: Gently push the ball forward using the stick (not hitting, but pushing with control)
- **Following the ball**: Keep your eyes on the ball and the stick working together
- **Putting it together**: Move the ball across the space, stop it, and turn with it

**Coaching cues**:
- "Hold your stick with both hands - pretend you're holding a big candy cane!"
- "Gently push the ball like you're helping it roll down a gentle hill"
- "Keep your stick low - imagine it's a snake slithering along the ground"
- "Follow your ball with your eyes - watch where it goes!"
- "You're doing great! Nice and gentle with that stick"

#### Guided Play/Game (3-5 minutes)

**Game structure**: "Gentle Push to Goal"
- Divide children into two small teams (or play as one big team for younger children)
- Place two goal areas (marked with cones) at opposite ends of the play space
- Each child gets a turn to push the soft ball toward their team's goal
- All children cheer and celebrate when the ball reaches the goal area

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Sticks stay low - no stick swinging
2. Gently push the ball - no hitting
3. Everyone gets a turn to push
4. We cheer for everyone on both teams

**Variations**:
- **Partner push**: Child and adult work together to push the ball to the goal
- **Group push**: All children work together to push one ball to the goal (cooperative version)
- **Multiple balls**: Have 2-3 soft balls in play so more children are active at once
- **Cone weaving**: Push the ball between cones in a gentle zigzag pattern instead of straight to a goal

**Turn-taking** (if applicable):
- For groups, use a simple system: one child pushes while others wait in a line or cheer
- To manage waiting, have waiting children be "cheerleaders" - they cheer for the player taking their turn
- Rotate every 2-3 turns so everyone gets multiple opportunities

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

- Let children freely explore with their sticks and balls in the play area
- Encourage them to experiment with pushing the ball in different directions
- Observe their movements and offer gentle encouragement
- Allow children to play cooperatively or independently based on their preference
- Observe who is gaining confidence and who may need more support

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually decrease heart rate and energy level, transition to calm activities, and provide positive closure

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow walking with the stick - children walk slowly around the space, holding their stick, breathing deeply
2. Stick stretches - gently stretch arms overhead while holding the stick (or pretend to stretch like a tree)
3. Sitting with stick - sit down and hold the stick across the lap, take three deep breaths

**Transition**: "Great work today! Let's slow down. Now let's walk slowly with our stick and take some deep breaths. Breathe in... and out. Let's gently stretch up high with our stick. Now let's sit down for a moment and rest with our stick across our lap."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Use only one light stick for the whole group to share (pass it around)
- Focus on pushing practice rather than goal-oriented play
- Keep play space very small (15x15 feet)
- Use larger, softer balls (6-8 inches)
- Allow children to play independently without strict rules about teams or goals
- Provide more hands-on support and demonstration
- Use shorter activity segments (5-10 minute total duration)

**Duration**: 8-12 minutes total

**Adult support**:
- Stand next to each child and guide their hand motions
- Hold the stick with them at first, then gradually release support
- Provide frequent verbal encouragement and celebration
- Be prepared to stop the activity if children become frustrated or overwhelmed

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Introduce two teams with simple team identity (different colored armbands or pinnies)
- Create specific goal areas to push balls toward
- Practice pushing the ball in different directions (forward, to the side, backward)
- Introduce a simple score concept: "Each time our team gets the ball to the goal, we cheer!"
- Add obstacle courses: push the ball between cones, around obstacles, along a line
- Practice controlled stops: push the ball and then stop it with the stick

**Duration**: Can extend to 15-18 minutes

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**: "You're learning how to push with your stick! Watch the ball move! Great control! I love how gently you're pushing!"
- **What to avoid**: Don't use pressure language like "faster," "harder," or "try again" repeatedly. Avoid comparing children's abilities to each other.
- **When to help**: Help when a child requests it or when frustration is building. Let them struggle productively with the stick control for short periods. Offer hand-over-hand guidance if they're not making progress after a few minutes.

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child swings the stick in the air instead of pushing the ball
**Why**: Young children naturally want to swing objects, and controlling the direction of a push requires more fine motor control than a swing
**Solution**: Gently redirect and demonstrate the pushing motion. Use the cue "snake slides along the ground" to keep the stick low. If swinging continues, practice pushes without the ball first, just moving the stick along the ground
**Timeline**: This improves significantly by age 4 with regular practice

**Challenge**: Child hits the ball too hard with the stick
**Why**: Children are still developing force control and don't understand the difference between pushing and striking
**Solution**: Demonstrate the difference between a gentle push and a hit. Use phrases like "soft push like butter melting" vs "hard hit." Model it several times. Let them feel the difference by gently guiding their arm
**Timeline**: Force control typically improves by mid-3-year-old stage with consistent practice

**Challenge**: Child loses interest quickly or won't use the stick
**Why**: The activity may be too frustrating, too structured, or the equipment doesn't feel right in their hands
**Solution**: Let them observe others first. Try a lighter stick (pool noodle). Play a simpler version without goals. Make it more game-like with exciting sounds and celebration. Let them control the pace
**Timeline**: Interest usually builds over 2-3 sessions as comfort increases

**Challenge**: Unsafe stick handling (swinging near other children's faces)
**Why**: Lack of spatial awareness and impulse control at this age
**Solution**: Establish a clear "STICK DOWN" signal that stops all play immediately. Practice this signal during warm-up. Use more space between children. Consider smaller groups with closer supervision
**Timeline**: Safety awareness improves around age 4, but ongoing supervision is essential

### Safety Reminders

- Always supervise stick play closely - never step away from the activity
- Ensure sticks stay low and pushing motions are controlled
- Check equipment for splinters or damage before and after each session
- Stop play immediately if any child is swinging sticks unsafely
- Keep children spaced adequately apart (6+ feet)
- Do not allow stick play in areas with hard objects that could cause injury if children fall

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Child can hold the stick with both hands and push the ball forward
- Control improves - ball movement becomes more predictable
- Child can stop the rolling ball using the stick
- Interest in repeated attempts increases
- Confidence with the equipment grows (less hesitation in handling)
- Ability to work with a partner or small team emerges

**When to add challenge**:
- When child can consistently push and stop the ball, add obstacle courses
- When child shows comfort with equipment, introduce team concepts
- When pushing motion is reliable, introduce goal-directed play
- When child requests more challenge or shows mastery of basic skills
