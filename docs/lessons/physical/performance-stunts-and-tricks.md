# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Performance Stunts and Tricks

## Activity Summary

Performance stunts and tricks introduces children to the exciting world of acrobatic moves, body tricks, and impressive physical feats adapted for young ages. Through practicing stunts like cartwheels, handstands, balancing tricks, and creative body positions, children develop confidence, body awareness, strength, and coordination. This activity celebrates physical capability and encourages children to challenge themselves safely while discovering what their bodies can do. Stunt practice builds courage, spatial awareness, and provides a foundation for more advanced gymnastics or acrobatics.

**Activity Type**: Gross motor play / Sport-based

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: High

**Best Environment**: Gymnasium with mats, outdoor grassy area, or living room with soft surfaces

**Space Required**: 15x20 feet minimum (clear space with soft landing surfaces)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Thick exercise mat or gymnastics mat (minimum 4x6 feet) - provides safe landing surface for stunts
- Additional padding or folded blankets - create softer surface for landings
- Clear floor or grassy surface - surrounding mat area

**Optional enhancements**:
- Foam blocks or steps - for building complexity and safe elevations
- Balance beam or low rail - for balance trick practice
- Mirror or video capability - for child to see themselves performing
- Music with motivational beat - adds fun and energy
- Props (ribbons, scarves) - for incorporating into tricks

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use folded blankets, pillows, and cushions layered as mat
- Create soft landing zone with pillows and comforters
- Use sturdy furniture as props for tricks
- Use lawn or grassy area outdoors for softer surface

**Cost estimate**: Free (household items) to $30 (if purchasing gymnastics mat)

**Safety equipment**: Well-padded exercise mat, soft landing surface, spotting (hand support from adult)

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear large area of all obstacles, furniture, and hazards
2. Set up thick, well-padded mat as main work surface
3. Create additional padding around mat for safety
4. Ensure adequate ceiling height (at least 8-10 feet) for overhead tricks
5. Remove any items that could cause injury if fallen on
6. Inspect mat for tears or damage

**Boundaries**: Define practice area clearly; mat is main work zone; area around mat is safe boundary

**Safety considerations**:
- Adult must provide spotting (hand support) for potentially risky stunts
- Never force child into advanced tricks before foundational skills
- Stop immediately if child reports pain or discomfort
- Ensure soft landing surface under all stunt attempts
- Watch for dizziness, especially after spinning or head-down positions
- Avoid stunts that hyperextend the spine
- Never allow unsupervised stunt attempts
- Check for signs of fear or reluctance and honor them
- Ensure child is warm and muscles are ready before advanced tricks

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Warm up muscles and joints; prepare body for more advanced movements and tricks

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Jogging in place - Jog on mat to elevate heart rate and warm muscles
2. Arm and leg swings - Swing arms and legs to loosen joints and increase mobility
3. Stretching sequence - Gentle stretches for hamstrings, shoulders, and wrists

**Warm-up cues**: "Let's get our bodies warm and ready for some fun tricks! Jog with me. Now let's swing our arms. Feel your body getting warm and flexible!"

### Main Activity (10-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Explain that they're going to learn amazing tricks their body can do
- Show one impressive but simple trick to build excitement
- Emphasize that we start with easy tricks and work up to harder ones
- Explain safety rule: "I'll help you and make sure you're safe"

#### Skill Practice (5-9 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:

**1. Forward Roll**:
- Start in squat position with hands on mat
- Tuck chin to chest
- Roll forward over shoulders (not head or neck)
- Use hands to help guide and control roll
- End in squat position

**2. Backward Roll**:
- Start in squat position
- Rock back gently onto shoulders
- Use hands to support and control roll
- Roll over shoulders and onto feet
- End in standing position

**3. Headstand or Shoulder Stand**:
- Start on knees and hands
- Place hands near head, creating triangle support
- Gently shift weight toward hands
- With adult spotting, extend legs up
- (Note: Full headstand may not be appropriate; shoulder stand may be safer)

**4. Cartwheel**:
- Start standing with arms extended overhead
- Step forward and place hands on mat
- Kick legs over body in sideways rotation
- Land on other foot
- Adult provides spotting support on hips

**5. Balance Tricks**:
- One-legged stand - balance on one foot for 10+ seconds
- Walk on tiptoes - move across mat on tiptoes
- Heel-to-toe walking - walk in straight line heel to toe

**Coaching cues**:
- "You're so strong! Look what your body can do!"
- "I've got you - you're safe. Ready to try it?"
- "Roll gently over your shoulders, not your head. That's it!"
- "You did it! That was amazing!"

#### Guided Play/Game (3-5 minutes)

**Game structure**: Create fun stunt combinations and challenges that build progressively

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. I'll show you the trick first
2. I'll help keep you safe
3. We'll try it together
4. No forcing - only what feels good

**Variations**:
- "Stunt Sequence" - create 3-4 tricks in a row (forward roll, then cartwheel, then balance)
- "Trick Challenge" - pick a trick and see how many times in a row child can do it
- "Silly Stunts" - create goofy tricks (walk backwards, hop on one foot, wiggle movements)
- "Partner Tricks" - simple partner stunts or stacking (with adult supporting)
- "Slow Motion Tricks" - perform tricks in very slow motion
- "Backwards Tricks" - do tricks backward (walk backward, move backward through space)

**Turn-taking**: Adult demonstrates, child watches and imitates; adult provides hands-on spotting

#### Free Exploration (1-2 minutes)
- Let child attempt tricks they've learned or try their own combinations
- Offer spotting support but allow some independence
- Celebrate creative attempts even if not "perfect"
- Encourage them to show you their favorite trick

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Bring heart rate down; stretch muscles; transition to calmer activity

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow stretching sequence - Stretch major muscle groups gently
2. Deep breathing - Lie on back and take 5-10 deep breaths
3. Reflection - Discuss favorite trick and accomplishments

**Transition**: "You did so many amazing tricks today! Let's slow down and stretch our muscles. You should feel proud of yourself!"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Modifications**:
- Focus on simple rolls and balance tricks only
- Avoid advanced stunts requiring significant strength or coordination
- Shorter session (10-12 minutes)
- Adult provides extensive hands-on support (spotting on hips, back, shoulders)
- Emphasize rolling and falling safely rather than complex tricks
- Use more playful language ("Somersaults," "Tumbles," "Rolling")
- Allow frequent rests and position changes
- Keep expectations low for precision or "perfect" execution

**Duration**: 10-12 minutes

**Adult support**: Very hands-on - provide physical support for every stunt, demonstrate alongside child, provide lots of encouragement

### 3-4+ years
**Challenges to add**:
- More complex tricks (cartwheels with decreasing support, proper headstands)
- Longer holds in balance positions (20+ seconds)
- Stunt combinations and sequences
- Less adult support; child attempts with verbal cuing
- Add speed elements (faster rolling, more dynamic movements)
- Include more challenging balance challenges
- Incorporate props into tricks
- Add performance elements (showing to audience)

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips
- **What to say**: "Look at you! You're so brave! You learned a new trick! I can see how strong your muscles are. You should be so proud of yourself!"
- **What to avoid**: Don't say "that's not quite right" or criticize form; avoid comparing to other children; don't push beyond child's confidence level
- **When to help**: Provide physical spotting support, demonstrate movements closely, use hands to guide, offer lots of encouragement and positive feedback

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is fearful of attempting stunts or worried about falling
**Why**: Young children may have legitimate safety concerns; fear of falling is developmentally normal
**Solution**: Start with very simple, low-risk tricks; provide reassuring physical support; practice falling safely first; build confidence gradually; never force
**Timeline**: Confidence grows with successful experiences; respect individual fear responses

**Challenge**: Child lacks body awareness or struggles with motor coordination in stunts
**Why**: Complex stunt movements require significant neuromuscular coordination; some children develop this later
**Solution**: Break tricks into smaller steps; practice component parts separately; provide more verbal and physical guidance; focus on effort rather than perfect form
**Timeline**: Coordination improves significantly by age 4-5

**Challenge**: Child becomes overconfident and attempts unsafe tricks without spotting
**Why**: Young children have limited risk assessment abilities; success can lead to overconfidence
**Solution**: Establish clear rules about needing spotting; provide consistent supervision; redirect unsafe attempts; praise safe choices
**Timeline**: Risk assessment and impulse control improve gradually through ages 4-6

### Safety Reminders
- Always provide spotting (hand support) for advanced stunts
- Ensure adequate mat and padding underneath all stunt attempts
- Never force child into tricks they're afraid of
- Stop if child reports pain, dizziness, or discomfort
- Maintain appropriate ceiling height clearance
- Avoid stunts that hyperextend the spine
- Don't allow unsupervised stunt practice
- Check child's physical condition before doing stunts
- Respect reluctance or fear - build confidence gradually

### Progress Tracking
**Signs of skill development**:
- Increasing confidence in attempting new tricks
- More controlled and precise movements
- Longer balance holds with better stability
- Ability to execute tricks with less adult spotting
- Shows understanding of safety rules
- Requests to practice specific tricks
- Demonstrates courage in trying new challenges
- Better body awareness and control

**When to add challenge**: When child shows confidence and safety awareness; can execute tricks with good control; requests more difficult challenges
