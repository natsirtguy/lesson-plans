# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Progressive Muscle Relaxation

## Activity Summary

Progressive muscle relaxation introduces children to the powerful technique of intentionally tensing and then releasing different muscle groups throughout the body. By learning to recognize the difference between tension and relaxation, children develop greater body awareness, emotional regulation, and stress relief skills. This calming practice builds a foundation for lifelong relaxation techniques while helping children manage anxiety, improve sleep, and understand their physical responses to emotions.

**Activity Type**: Mind-body practice

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Low

**Best Environment**: Living room, bedroom, or quiet classroom space

**Space Required**: 6x8 feet minimum (space for child to lie down)

**Safety considerations**:
- Ensure child is not hungry or overstimulated before beginning
- Watch for signs of restlessness or discomfort
- Never force child to participate if resistant
- Avoid doing PMR immediately after eating
- Stop if child reports pain or extreme discomfort
- Be aware that deep relaxation can sometimes trigger emotional releases in sensitive children

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (1-2 minutes)

**Purpose**: Settle the body and mind, prepare for focused attention on muscle sensations

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Settling into position - Lie down on mat, adjust pillow, find comfortable position; wiggle and get settled
2. Awareness breathing - Place hands on belly, take 3-5 slow deep breaths, noticing belly rise and fall
3. Body scan preview - Mentally notice different parts of body from head to feet without moving

**Warm-up cues**: "Let's get comfortable. Find a position where your body feels happy. Now let's breathe slowly and notice our whole body."

### Main Activity (7-12 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Explain that we're going to tighten different parts of our body, then let them relax
- Show the difference between tension and relaxation: make a tight fist, hold for 2 seconds, then release and notice the difference
- Explain that relaxation feels good and calm
- Reassure that this is safe and nothing will hurt

#### Skill Practice (5-8 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:

**1. Hand & Arm Tension Release**:
- Make tight fists with both hands; hold for 2-3 seconds
- Really tense the hands hard
- Then let them go completely loose and relaxed
- Notice the difference between tight and loose
- Repeat 1-2 times

**2. Shoulder & Neck Tension Release**:
- Shrug shoulders up toward ears; tense as tight as possible for 2-3 seconds
- Then drop shoulders down and let them be heavy and relaxed
- Notice the difference and how good relaxation feels
- Repeat 1-2 times

**3. Face & Head Tension Release**:
- Scrunch up the whole face (like you tasted something sour); hold for 2-3 seconds
- Relax and let face become soft and smooth
- Repeat 1-2 times
- Note: Make this playful and fun rather than serious

**4. Belly & Core Tension Release**:
- Tighten belly muscles as tight as possible; hold for 2-3 seconds
- Release and let belly be soft and relaxed
- Breathe deeply into relaxed belly
- Repeat 1-2 times

**5. Leg & Foot Tension Release**:
- Tighten leg muscles, point toes down; hold for 2-3 seconds
- Release and let legs become heavy and relaxed
- Notice feet becoming loose and slack
- Repeat 1-2 times

**Coaching cues**:
- "Make it really, really tight... hold it... hold it... now let it go and feel how soft it becomes"
- "That tight feeling means your muscles are working. This relaxed feeling is what we want."
- "You can feel your muscles learning to be calm and peaceful"
- "Let that tension melt away like ice cream melting in the sun"

#### Guided Play/Game (1-2 minutes)

**Game structure**: Incorporate imagination into tension/relaxation cycle

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Tighten when I say to tighten
2. Relax when I say to relax
3. Notice how it feels

**Variations**:
- "Tight as a rock, soft as a cloud" - combine tightening with visualization
- "Robot to rag doll" - pretend to be a stiff robot, then become a floppy rag doll
- "Shaking it out" - after relaxation, gently shake out limbs to release final tension
- "Squeeze and breathe" - combine each tension with an exhale

**Turn-taking**: Adult guides, child follows; can also have child guide adult in playful way

#### Free Exploration (1 minute)
- Allow child to just rest quietly in relaxed state
- Let them notice how the whole body feels calm
- Encourage them to keep breathing slowly and gently

### Cool-Down (1-2 minutes)

**Purpose**: Transition from activity to rest state; consolidate the relaxation

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Full body scan - Slowly mentally scan from head to feet, noticing any remaining tension and releasing it
2. Heavy body - Imagine the whole body becoming heavy and sinking into the mat
3. Peaceful moment - Lie quietly for 10-15 seconds with no instruction, just breathing

**Transition**: "Your whole body is feeling calm and relaxed now. Let's just lie here quietly and feel how peaceful you are."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Modifications**:
- Keep it very short and playful (6-10 minutes)
- Focus on only 2-3 body parts (hands, shoulders, face)
- Use very simple language and imagery
- Make it more game-like than meditative
- Adult demonstrates with exaggerated movements
- Allow frequent wiggling and position changes
- Shorter hold times (1-2 seconds for tension)

**Duration**: 6-10 minutes

**Adult support**: Hands-on guidance, lots of verbal encouragement, model all movements, stay very playful

### 3-4+ years
**Challenges to add**:
- Include more body parts (add legs, feet, core)
- Longer tension holds (up to 3-4 seconds)
- Longer relaxation periods (10-15 seconds lying still)
- Incorporate deeper breathing with relaxation
- Add more complex visualizations
- Include full body tension and release sequence

**Duration**: 12-15 minutes

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips
- **What to say**: "You're learning to make your muscles relax and feel calm. That tight feeling is your muscles working. Now feel how good relaxation feels. You're doing great!"
- **What to avoid**: Don't say "make it hurt" or use language suggesting pain; avoid saying muscles should be "super tight"; don't compare tension to negative things
- **When to help**: Guide into positions, verbally cue each step, demonstrate movements exaggerated so child can see clearly, offer hand support

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child thinks this is "boring" or gets restless during relaxation phase
**Why**: Young children prefer active, stimulating activities; quiet stillness is less naturally engaging
**Solution**: Make the tensing phase more exaggerated and playful; keep relaxation periods short; use music or calming sounds; incorporate more imagery and imagination
**Timeline**: Appreciation for quiet activities increases with age and maturity

**Challenge**: Child has difficulty tensing muscles on purpose or doesn't understand tension concept
**Why**: Young children may not have developed awareness of muscle tension; the concept is somewhat abstract
**Solution**: Use very exaggerated, visible tensing (make it huge and obvious); compare to familiar experiences ("Like when you hold your pee," or "Like trying hard to jump"); do it together side-by-side
**Timeline**: Improves significantly by age 4 as body awareness develops

**Challenge**: Child falls asleep during the activity
**Why**: Relaxation techniques are very calming and can trigger drowsiness in tired children
**Solution**: Do earlier in day before nap time; keep it slightly shorter; use slightly more upbeat language; this is actually not a bad outcome if done before bedtime
**Timeline**: N/A; adjust timing rather than technique

### Safety Reminders
- Never force child to participate or lie still if unwilling
- Stop immediately if child complains of any discomfort
- Avoid doing on a full stomach
- Ensure room is at comfortable temperature (can add blanket if cool)
- Watch for anxiety; some children may find intense focus on body sensations unsettling
- Keep progressive muscle relaxation to 1-2 times per week maximum

### Progress Tracking
**Signs of skill development**:
- Increasingly able to tense muscles intentionally
- Recognizes difference between tension and relaxation
- Can relax more fully with less adult guidance
- Shows improved body awareness in daily activities
- Demonstrates calmer behavior after sessions
- Can follow simple relaxation sequences independently

**When to add challenge**: When child can complete basic sequence with good control; shows understanding of tension vs. relaxation; requests to do activity again
