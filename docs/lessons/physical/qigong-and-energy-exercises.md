# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Qigong and Energy Exercises

## Activity Summary

Qigong and energy exercises introduce children to gentle, flowing movements synchronized with breathing that promote body awareness, calm focus, and internal balance. This mind-body practice builds coordination, body control, and emotional regulation while introducing basic concepts of energy flow and connection to the body. Young children develop improved breathing awareness, learn simple meditative movement, and experience the calming, centering benefits of flowing motion paired with mindful breathing.

**Activity Type**: Mind-body practice

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Low to Moderate

**Best Environment**: Quiet indoor space, living room, bedroom, or gentle outdoor setting

**Space Required**: 8x10 feet minimum (less space needed than active sports)

4. Turn off phones and reduce noise
5. Dim lighting if possible
6. Ensure space is clean and hygienic
7. Have water available but outside practice area

**Boundaries**:
- Create calm zone with clear space for movement
- Use yoga mats to define practice area
- Minimize visual distractions in view
- Create sense of enclosure (corner vs. middle of room works well)

**Safety considerations**:
- Ensure flooring is not slippery
- Remove hazards, but this is already a very safe activity
- Keep environment calm and non-threatening

- Ensure child is not hungry or uncomfortable
- Watch that child doesn't become chilled during slow practice
- No pressure or forcing - only gentle invitation to participate

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (1-2 minutes)

**Purpose**: Transition from active state to calm focus, begin body awareness, establish breathing connection

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Gentle swaying - "Sway gently, feeling yourself grounded"
2. Arm stretches overhead - slow, gentle extension
3. Awareness breathing - "Feel your breath flowing in and out"

**Warm-up cues**: "We're getting ready to move slowly and gently. Let's pay attention to our breath and how our body feels. This is a calm, peaceful time."

### Main Activity (8-12 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Explain that qigong is about slow, calm movements and breathing
- Show that we're moving to help our body feel good and calm
- Demonstrate standing in center posture: feet shoulder-width apart, knees soft, arms relaxed
- Explain: "We're going to move slowly and breathe together. This helps our body feel calm and peaceful"

#### Skill Practice (4-6 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
- Centered standing posture: rooted yet relaxed
- Belly breathing: breathing deeply into the belly rather than shallow chest breathing
- Flowing arm movements: smooth, continuous motion synchronized with breath
- Weight shifting: gently shifting weight side to side or forward/back
- Combined movement and breath: coordinating movement with inhalation and exhalation

**Coaching cues**:
- "Feel your feet on the ground like roots of a tree"
- "Breathe slowly and deeply - feel your belly expand"
- "Let your arms float up as you breathe in, float down as you breathe out"
- "Smooth like water, no rushing, no stopping"
- "Feel the calm in your body as you move and breathe"

#### Guided Practice (4-6 minutes)

**Practice structure**: "Flowing Water" Sequence
- Demonstrate and practice 3-4 simple movements repeated in sequence
- Each movement coordinates with breath cycle (inhale, exhale, hold)
- Repeat sequence 3-4 times to build rhythm and relaxation
- Focus on smooth, continuous flow rather than perfect form

**Basic Sequence Example**:
1. Stand centered, breathe normally for 5 breaths
2. Inhale, slowly raise arms to shoulder height
3. Exhale, slowly lower arms back to sides
4. Pause and breathe
5. Repeat 4-5 times

**Variations**:
- "Rising Moon" where arms float up during inhale, float down during exhale
- "Gentle Waves" where body sways side to side while arms flow
- "Opening Lotus" where arms open and close like a flower blooming
- "Tree Growing" where arms extend upward during growth, settle during rest
- "Cloud Walking" where child walks slowly while moving arms in flowing patterns

**Turn-taking** (if applicable):
- Lead group together in synchronized movement
- Children follow adult's pace and timing
- No pressure for perfect form - focus on feeling and breath

#### Free Exploration (1-2 minutes)
Let children experiment with slow, flowing movements
- What feels peaceful to them?
- How does their breath change with movement?
- When to observe: Watch for relaxation and focus, enjoy the calm

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Complete the practice, integrate the calm, return gradually to normal awareness

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Gentle standing meditation - standing still, feeling the calm in body
2. Hand massage - rubbing palms together gently, massaging face
3. Final breathing - three slow, deep breaths with arms at sides

**Transition**: "Feel how calm and peaceful your body is right now. Carry this calm feeling with you. We're done with our gentle practice."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Keep movements very simple - just 1-2 movement patterns
- Make movements playful and imaginative (floating like a butterfly, growing like a flower)
- Very short practice (5-8 minutes)
- Adult provides constant modeling
- Use lots of imagery and storytelling
- Expect limited focus and attention
- No expectation of "correct" breathing - just gentle exploration
- Use hand-over-hand guidance if needed

**Duration**: 5-8 minutes

**Adult support**: High - constant modeling, providing imagery, guiding movements, keeping energy calm and supportive, may need to do practice solo while child observes

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- More complex movement sequences (3-5 movements in flow)
- Longer practice duration (12-15 minutes)
- Introduction of directional breathing cues
- Understanding of energy concepts in simple terms
- Longer holds in stationary positions
- More focus on breath coordination with movement
- Introduction of visualization (imagine energy flowing, imagine healing light)
- Ability to follow longer sequences without constant adult modeling

**Duration**: Can extend to 12-15 minutes

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**: "Look how smoothly you're moving! Your breathing is so calm. I can see how peaceful you feel. This is wonderful - your body and mind are working together."
- **What to avoid**: Pushing for "perfect" form, rushing the pace, introducing competition or comparison, forcing participation, making it feel like exercise
- **When to help**: Guide movements gently for younger children; older children need mostly observational support. Model breathing and movement yourself - your calm presence is the best teacher.

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes distracted or wiggly
**Why**: Natural for young children; may not understand the concept of "calm practice"; environment may have distractions; child may not be ready for this activity yet
**Solution**: Shorten practice significantly, reduce distractions, add more playful imagery, use music or sound, practice at different time of day, take break, return to activity when child is calmer
**Timeline**: Focus and calmness typically develop ages 3-4+; some younger children may not be ready for this activity for several more months

**Challenge**: Child holds breath or becomes tense during practice
**Why**: Trying too hard; doesn't understand how to breathe naturally; anxious; focused too much on "doing it right"
**Solution**: Remind "just breathe naturally, no special way," use fun breathing imagery (smell a flower, blow out candles), take break if needed, emphasize there's no wrong way, practice breathing separately from movement
**Timeline**: Usually improves as child relaxes into activity; may take several sessions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't seem interested or wants to do something active instead
**Why**: Temperament - some children prefer high-energy activity; natural - not everyone enjoys qigong; may need different time or format; possible need for more active play first to tire out
**Solution**: Try at different time (after active play, not before), skip this activity and try again in 3-6 months, offer option but don't force, use more playful, imaginative approach, ensure child has adequate active play first
**Timeline**: Interest in calm practices typically develops ages 3-4+; some children naturally prefer high energy

### Safety Reminders

- This is one of the safest physical activities for young children
- Ensure child is comfortable and warm during practice
- Never force breathing or hold breath - always allow natural breathing
- Watch for signs child is becoming cold (qigong is low intensity)
- Stop immediately if child becomes anxious or uncomfortable
- Never introduce scary visualization or intense imagery
- Keep environment calm and supportive, never pressuring
- This activity is about wellbeing, not exercise or punishment

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Ability to focus for longer periods during practice
- Showing visible relaxation (soft face, relaxed shoulders)
- Breathing becoming slower and deeper during practice
- Moving with more grace and fluidity
- Demonstrating body awareness and control
- Showing calmness after practice session
- Requesting the activity ("Can we do qigong?")
- Attempting to replicate movements independently

**When to add challenge**:
- When child can focus for 8-10 minutes with minimal distraction
- When child demonstrates relaxation during practice
- When child can follow 3-4 movement sequences
- When child shows interest in practicing longer or more complex movements
- When child initiates calm movement practice independently
