# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Qigong and Energy Exercises

## Activity Summary

Qigong and energy exercises introduce children to gentle, flowing movements synchronized with breathing that promote body awareness, calm focus, and internal balance. This mind-body practice builds coordination, body control, and emotional regulation while introducing basic concepts of energy flow and connection to the body. Young children develop improved breathing awareness, learn simple meditative movement, and experience the calming, centering benefits of flowing motion paired with mindful breathing.

**Activity Type**: Mind-body practice

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Low to Moderate

**Best Environment**: Quiet indoor space, living room, bedroom, or gentle outdoor setting

**Space Required**: 8x10 feet minimum (less space needed than active sports)

## Vocabulary

**Diaphragm**: The dome-shaped muscle beneath your lungs that powers breathing. When you inhale deeply (as in qigong belly breathing), the diaphragm contracts and flattens, pulling air into the lungs by creating a vacuum. This deep diaphragmatic breathing draws 6-8 times more air than shallow chest breathing. The diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve, which originates in the neck — one of the longest single-function nerves in the body.

**Parasympathetic Nervous System**: The "rest and digest" branch of your autonomic nervous system. Slow, deep breathing — the foundation of qigong — activates the parasympathetic system through the vagus nerve (the longest cranial nerve, running from brainstem to abdomen). This lowers heart rate, reduces blood pressure, decreases cortisol (stress hormone), and increases digestion. The opposite system — sympathetic ("fight or flight") — speeds everything up. Qigong deliberately shifts the balance from sympathetic toward parasympathetic dominance.

**Proprioception**: Your body's sense of its own position in space, sometimes called the "sixth sense." Proprioceptors — specialized sensors in your muscles, tendons, and joints — continuously report your body's position to the cerebellum without you needing to look. Qigong's slow, deliberate movements heighten proprioceptive awareness because moving slowly requires more precise feedback from these sensors. Standing meditation (zhan zhuang) is essentially pure proprioceptive training.

**Fascia**: A continuous web of connective tissue that wraps every muscle, organ, bone, and nerve in your body — like a three-dimensional body stocking. Fascia contains more sensory nerve endings than muscle and plays a major role in force transmission and body awareness. Qigong's slow, whole-body movements are thought to stimulate fascial sliding and hydration (fascia needs movement to stay supple). When fascia becomes dehydrated or stuck, it restricts movement — the "stiffness" you feel after sitting still for too long.

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Choose quiet, calm space away from distractions
2. Remove or minimize visual clutter
3. Ensure comfortable temperature (may want light blanket nearby)
4. Turn off phones and reduce noise
5. Dim lighting if possible
6. Ensure space is clean and hygienic
7. Have water available but outside practice area

**Boundaries**:
- Create calm zone with clear space for movement
- Use yoga mats to define practice area
- Minimize visual distractions in view
- Create sense of enclosure (corner vs. middle of room works well)

**Safety considerations**:
- Ensure flooring is not slippery
- Remove hazards, but this is already a very safe activity
- Keep environment calm and non-threatening
- Avoid overly hot or cold spaces
- Ensure child is not hungry or uncomfortable
- Watch that child doesn't become chilled during slow practice
- No pressure or forcing - only gentle invitation to participate

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (1-2 minutes)

**Purpose**: Transition from active state to calm focus, begin body awareness, establish breathing connection

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Gentle swaying - "Sway gently, feeling yourself grounded"
2. Arm stretches overhead - slow, gentle extension
3. Awareness breathing - "Feel your breath flowing in and out"

**Warm-up cues**: "We're getting ready to move slowly and gently. Let's pay attention to our breath and how our body feels. This is a calm, peaceful time."

### Main Activity (8-12 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- "Qigong uses slow movement and deep breathing to activate your parasympathetic nervous system — the 'rest and digest' part of your nervous system. When you breathe slowly and deeply, your vagus nerve sends signals to your brain that lower your heart rate and reduce cortisol, the stress hormone."
- Demonstrate standing posture: feet shoulder-width apart, knees soft. "Notice how many tiny muscles are working to keep you balanced right now — your proprioceptors in your ankles, knees, and hips are sending thousands of signals per second to your cerebellum to keep you upright."
- "When we move slowly, we train our proprioception — our body's sense of where it is in space. Fast movements are easier because momentum carries you; slow movements require much more precise control."

#### Skill Practice (4-6 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
- Centered standing posture: activating proprioceptors in ankles, knees, and hips for balance feedback
- Diaphragmatic breathing: engaging the diaphragm to draw air deep into the lungs (6-8x more volume than chest breathing)
- Flowing arm movements: slow, continuous motion that trains proprioception and stimulates fascial sliding
- Weight shifting: lateral and anterior/posterior weight transfer, training the vestibular system and ankle proprioceptors
- Breath-movement coordination: linking diaphragm cycles to limb movement, which activates the vagus nerve and shifts toward parasympathetic dominance

**Coaching cues**:
- "Feel your feet pressing into the ground. Your proprioceptors — sensors in your ankles and feet — are telling your cerebellum exactly how your weight is distributed."
- "Breathe into your belly — your diaphragm is flattening, creating a vacuum that pulls air deep into your lungs. Much deeper than chest breathing."
- "Let your arms float up as you inhale — your deltoids are contracting very slowly. Exhale and lower — now gravity is helping while your deltoids control the descent (eccentric contraction)."
- "Moving this slowly is harder than moving fast because your cerebellum needs more precise proprioceptive feedback to control each millimeter of movement."
- "Each slow exhale activates your vagus nerve, which sends 'calm down' signals to your heart and digestive system — that's the parasympathetic nervous system working."

#### Guided Practice (4-6 minutes)

**Practice structure**: "Flowing Water" Sequence
- Demonstrate and practice 3-4 simple movements repeated in sequence
- Each movement coordinates with breath cycle (inhale, exhale, hold)
- Repeat sequence 3-4 times to build rhythm and relaxation
- Focus on smooth, continuous flow rather than perfect form

**Basic Sequence Example**:
1. Stand centered, breathe normally for 5 breaths
2. Inhale, slowly raise arms to shoulder height
3. Exhale, slowly lower arms back to sides
4. Pause and breathe
5. Repeat 4-5 times

**Variations**:
- "Rising Moon" where arms float up during inhale, float down during exhale
- "Gentle Waves" where body sways side to side while arms flow
- "Opening Lotus" where arms open and close like a flower blooming
- "Tree Growing" where arms extend upward during growth, settle during rest
- "Cloud Walking" where child walks slowly while moving arms in flowing patterns

**Turn-taking** (if applicable):
- Lead group together in synchronized movement
- Children follow adult's pace and timing
- No pressure for perfect form - focus on feeling and breath

#### Free Exploration (1-2 minutes)
Let children experiment with slow, flowing movements
- What feels peaceful to them?
- How does their breath change with movement?
- When to observe: Watch for relaxation and focus, enjoy the calm

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Complete the practice, integrate the calm, return gradually to normal awareness

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Gentle standing meditation - standing still, feeling the calm in body
2. Hand massage - rubbing palms together gently, massaging face
3. Final breathing - three slow, deep breaths with arms at sides

**Transition**: "Feel how calm and peaceful your body is right now. Carry this calm feeling with you. We're done with our gentle practice."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Keep movements very simple — just 1-2 movement patterns
- Name the body parts working: "Your diaphragm is under your ribs — feel it move when you breathe in!"
- Introduce proprioception simply: "Close your eyes and touch your nose. You can do it without looking because your body knows where your body is! That's called proprioception."
- Very short practice (5-8 minutes)
- Adult provides constant modeling
- Make it playful: "Float your arms up like a butterfly — your deltoid muscles are lifting them. Now let them float down — gravity is pulling while your muscles control the landing."
- No expectation of "correct" breathing — just awareness: "Can you feel your belly move when you breathe? That's your diaphragm!"

**Duration**: 5-8 minutes

**Adult support**: High - constant modeling, providing imagery, guiding movements, keeping energy calm and supportive, may need to do practice solo while child observes

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- More complex movement sequences (3-5 movements in flow) — challenges procedural memory in the cerebellum
- Longer practice duration (12-15 minutes) with sustained proprioceptive awareness
- Check pulse before and after practice: "Count heartbeats for 15 seconds, multiply by 4. Is your heart rate lower after practice? That's your parasympathetic nervous system — the vagus nerve slowed your heart down!"
- Standing meditation (zhan zhuang): hold a single position for 30-60 seconds. "Your proprioceptors are firing constantly to make micro-adjustments. Your body is never truly 'still' — it's a dynamic balance of thousands of tiny corrections per second."
- Discuss fascia: "Feel stiff when you wake up? Your fascia — the web of tissue wrapping every muscle — gets dehydrated overnight. Slow movement in the morning rehydrates it, like squeezing water through a sponge."
- Explore the relationship between breathing rate and heart rate: "Breathe in — heart speeds up slightly. Breathe out — heart slows down. This is called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and it's a sign of a healthy nervous system."
- Longer sequences without constant adult modeling to build motor independence

**Duration**: Can extend to 12-15 minutes

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**: "Look how smoothly you're moving! Your breathing is so calm. I can see how peaceful you feel. This is wonderful - your body and mind are working together."
- **What to avoid**: Pushing for "perfect" form, rushing the pace, introducing competition or comparison, forcing participation, making it feel like exercise
- **When to help**: Guide movements gently for younger children; older children need mostly observational support. Model breathing and movement yourself - your calm presence is the best teacher.

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes distracted or wiggly
**Why**: Natural for young children; may not understand the concept of "calm practice"; environment may have distractions; child may not be ready for this activity yet
**Solution**: Shorten practice significantly, reduce distractions, add more playful imagery, use music or sound, practice at different time of day, take break, return to activity when child is calmer
**Timeline**: Focus and calmness typically develop ages 3-4+; some younger children may not be ready for this activity for several more months

**Challenge**: Child holds breath or becomes tense during practice
**Why**: Trying too hard; doesn't understand how to breathe naturally; anxious; focused too much on "doing it right"
**Solution**: Remind "just breathe naturally, no special way," use fun breathing imagery (smell a flower, blow out candles), take break if needed, emphasize there's no wrong way, practice breathing separately from movement
**Timeline**: Usually improves as child relaxes into activity; may take several sessions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't seem interested or wants to do something active instead
**Why**: Temperament - some children prefer high-energy activity; natural - not everyone enjoys qigong; may need different time or format; possible need for more active play first to tire out
**Solution**: Try at different time (after active play, not before), skip this activity and try again in 3-6 months, offer option but don't force, use more playful, imaginative approach, ensure child has adequate active play first
**Timeline**: Interest in calm practices typically develops ages 3-4+; some children naturally prefer high energy

### Safety Reminders

- This is one of the safest physical activities for young children
- Ensure child is comfortable and warm during practice
- Never force breathing or hold breath - always allow natural breathing
- Watch for signs child is becoming cold (qigong is low intensity)
- Stop immediately if child becomes anxious or uncomfortable
- Never introduce scary visualization or intense imagery
- Keep environment calm and supportive, never pressuring
- This activity is about wellbeing, not exercise or punishment

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Ability to focus for longer periods during practice
- Showing visible relaxation (soft face, relaxed shoulders)
- Breathing becoming slower and deeper during practice
- Moving with more grace and fluidity
- Demonstrating body awareness and control
- Showing calmness after practice session
- Requesting the activity ("Can we do qigong?")
- Attempting to replicate movements independently

**When to add challenge**:
- When child can focus for 8-10 minutes with minimal distraction
- When child demonstrates relaxation during practice
- When child can follow 3-4 movement sequences
- When child shows interest in practicing longer or more complex movements
- When child initiates calm movement practice independently
