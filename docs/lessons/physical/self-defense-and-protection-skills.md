# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Self-Defense and Protection Skills

## Activity Summary

Self-defense and protection skills teach young children basic body safety, boundaries, and simple protective movements through playful exploration and role-play scenarios. This activity builds awareness of personal space, confidence in their body, and age-appropriate empowerment while emphasizing communication, seeking help from trusted adults, and that their body belongs to them. Children learn to recognize uncomfortable situations and practice saying "no" assertively while developing strong, controlled movement patterns.

**Activity Type**: Motor skill development / Life safety skill

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Moderate

**Best Environment**: Living room, gymnasium, or quiet safe space with open area

**Space Required**: 10x15 feet minimum

3. Mark personal space boundaries with tape or cones
4. Define "safe zone" where children can rest
5. Have water nearby
6. Ensure calm, safe environment (lower lighting if needed, quiet)

**Boundaries**:
- Use tape to mark a personal space circle around each child (3-4 feet radius)

- Keep boundaries visible throughout activity

**Safety considerations**:

- Never force a child to be touched or to demonstrate techniques on another child

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Build body awareness and confidence, establish safe environment, prepare for learning about protection

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Standing tall and taking up space - "Stand as big and strong as you can"
2. Feeling your body - gentle self-touch from head to toes - "Feel your head, shoulders, arms, legs"
3. Strong stance practice - feet apart, hands on hips - "Feel how strong your body is"

**Warm-up cues**: "Your body is strong and wonderful. It belongs to you. Let's feel how strong and capable you are!"

### Main Activity (8-12 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Explain that their body belongs to them and they can decide who touches it
- Discuss trusted adults - "Who are your safe people? People you trust completely?"
- Teach simple concept: "If something doesn't feel right, you can say no and tell a trusted adult"
- Frame activity: "We're learning to feel confident in our bodies and know it's okay to say no"

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
- Identifying safe people in their life (trusted adults)
- Recognizing when something feels uncomfortable
- Using a clear, strong voice to say "No" or "Stop"
- Simple body positions of strength and confidence
- Moving away from uncomfortable situations
- Seeking help from trusted adults

**Coaching cues**:
- "Your body is yours - no one can touch it without permission"
- "It's okay to say 'no' to any touch that doesn't feel right"
- "Your feelings matter - if something feels wrong, tell a trusted adult"
- "Stand tall and strong - feel how powerful your body is"
- "Use a big, clear voice: 'No, stop!'"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-6 minutes)

**Game structure**: "Boundary Practice" Role-Play
- Adult or trusted person approaches child slowly with a simple gesture (wave, friendly approach)
- Child practices saying "hello" if they want interaction
- Child practices moving away and saying "I need space" if they don't want interaction
- Practice with multiple trusted people if available
- Emphasize child has choice and control

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. The person approaching stops moving when you say "stop"
2. You get to decide if you want a hug, high-five, or no touch
3. It's always okay to say "no" or "I need space"
4. Trusted adults will always listen to your "no"

**Variations**:
- "Personal Space Game" where child holds a hula hoop or marked zone and practices setting boundaries
- "Voice Practice" where children practice saying "No" and "Stop" in strong, clear voices
- "Safe People List" where child identifies and talks about trusted adults
- "Feeling Check" where child learns to notice when something feels uncomfortable vs. comfortable

**Turn-taking** (if applicable):
- One child practices at a time while others observe
- Rotate roles so all children get practice

#### Free Exploration (1-2 minutes)
Let children experiment with their strong voice and body position
- How does it feel to say "no" in a strong voice?
- Can they find their own strong, confident stance?
- When to observe: Watch for assertiveness and confidence in voice

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Reinforce positive messages about body safety, transition to calm, ensure child feels supported

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Self-hug practice - "Give yourself a big hug"
2. Positive affirmations - "My body is strong. I can say no. I am safe"
3. Gentle breathing - "Deep breath in, slow breath out"

**Transition**: "You are strong and brave. Your body belongs to you. The trusted adults in your life are here to keep you safe."

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**: "I love how loud and clear your voice is! You are strong and brave. It's always okay to say no. I'm so proud of how you're protecting yourself."
- **What to avoid**: Creating fear or anxiety; using scary examples; making child feel they did something wrong; teaching to be suspicious of adults; saying "stranger danger"
- **When to help**: Always respond to a child saying no - stop what you're doing and respect their boundary, even if it's an emotional reaction. Model respectful boundaries with your own body.

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child becomes anxious or fearful during activity
**Why**: Young children can easily become scared by safety discussions; past experiences may create anxiety; they may worry about safety
**Solution**: Stop activity immediately, provide reassurance, focus on the people who keep them safe (not the dangers), use calm voice and body language, offer comfort, may need to skip this activity for now
**Timeline**: Some children need several months before ready for this topic; some may need to wait until older

**Challenge**: Child doesn't use strong voice or seems timid
**Why**: Developing confidence is gradual; some children are naturally quieter; may not understand why strong voice is important; modeling from adults affects this
**Solution**: Practice together in playful ways, use songs with the phrase "No!" or "Stop!", celebrate any attempt at assertiveness, model strong voice yourself, practice with familiar people first, understand this is a developing skill
**Timeline**: Confidence in assertiveness typically develops ages 3-5; some children need significant time and modeling

**Challenge**: Child is aggressive in practicing boundaries (pushing too hard)
**Why**: Doesn't understand the difference between assertiveness and aggression; processing big emotions; testing limits; excited about having power
**Solution**: Pause and discuss difference between strong voice and physical force, redirect to voice practice instead of physical, discuss respect and care for others, ensure they understand we protect others AND ourselves
**Timeline**: Understanding this distinction typically develops age 3-4+; may need consistent reminders

### Safety Reminders
