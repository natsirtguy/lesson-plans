# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Sensory Integration Activities

## Activity Summary

Sensory integration activities combine movement with multi-sensory experiences to help young children develop body awareness, coordination, and motor skills while engaging their senses. These activities use tactile, vestibular (balance and movement), and proprioceptive (body position) input to support developmental growth. This type of play is essential for building neural connections and helping children understand how their body moves through space.

**Activity Type**: Motor skill development

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Moderate

**Best Environment**: Indoor gymnasium, living room, or backyard

**Space Required**: 10x10 feet minimum

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Sensory materials (dried rice, dried beans, sand, water, kinetic sand) - 2-3 cups in shallow containers
- Soft textured items (blankets, scarves, sponges, soft brushes)
- Balance tools (balance beam, foam strip, or tape line on floor)
- Small objects to manipulate (wooden blocks, soft balls, foam shapes)
- Containers for pouring (cups, scoops, funnels)

**Optional enhancements**:
- Essential oil diffuser or scented materials - enhances olfactory awareness
- Music or nature sounds - supports auditory input
- Blindfold or fabric eye covering - encourages tactile focus
- Ramps or inclined surfaces - increases vestibular challenge
- Texture boards or sensory mats - additional tactile variety

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use household items: pasta, cereal, buttons in containers; old socks filled with rice; pillow cases for covering eyes
- Create a sensory bin from a plastic storage container
- Make texture surfaces with sandpaper, corduroy, bubble wrap taped to cardboard
- Use blankets and pillows for balance beam activities

**Cost estimate**: Free (household items)

**Safety equipment**: Washable covering (tarp or plastic) for sensory bins; hand sanitizer or wash station nearby

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear floor of tripping hazards; move furniture to perimeter
2. Lay down washable covering or tarp under sensory bins to catch spills
3. Arrange sensory stations in a circle or line so child can easily move between them
4. Place balance beam or tape line along one side of space
5. Set up wash area (wet towels, water bowl) nearby for cleanup

**Boundaries**: Use tape lines, chalk lines, or arrange equipment to define specific play zones; keep safe distance from walls and doors

**Safety considerations**:
- Small objects choking hazard - supervise closely with children under 3 years; use objects larger than toilet paper tube opening
- Sensory materials should be clean and food-safe if child is still mouthing items
- Avoid essential oils directly accessible; use diffuser only, never apply to skin
- Check that all containers are stable and won't tip easily
- Keep water activities shallow (no deeper than 2-3 inches); supervise constantly
- Ensure non-slip surface for balance activities (use yoga mat or non-slip tape)

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Activate the nervous system, increase body awareness, and prepare muscles and joints for sensory exploration

**Warm-up activities**:
1. March and stomp - "Let's wake up our feet! Stomp, stomp, stomp! Feel the ground under your feet!"
2. Arm circles and reaches - "Reach your arms up high like a tall tree, now let them fall gently. Feel your arms moving?"
3. Gentle twists and sways - "Sway like kelp in the ocean. Feel your whole body moving?"

**Warm-up cues**: "Let's get our bodies ready to explore! What parts of your body do you feel moving? Can you feel your feet, your arms, your tummy?"

### Main Activity (8-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- "Today we're going to have an adventure with our senses! We'll touch different things, move in different ways, and pay attention to how our bodies feel."
- Demonstrate touching your own hands: "Feel my hands with my fingers - smooth or rough? Let me feel your hand too. Soft, right?"
- Key coaching point: "There's no right or wrong way to explore. I want you to notice how things feel and how your body moves."

#### Skill Practice (3-6 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
- Tactile awareness: Identifying different textures through touch (smooth, rough, squishy, soft)
- Proprioceptive awareness: Understanding where body parts are in space and how they move
- Vestibular awareness: Experiencing balance and movement through space
- Bilateral coordination: Using both sides of body together in sensory exploration

**Coaching cues**:
- "Feel the texture with your whole hand, not just your fingers."
- "Notice what happens to your body as you move - do you feel your muscles working?"
- "It's okay if something feels icky or too much - you can stop and try something else."
- "There are no mistakes here, only discoveries!"

#### Guided Play/Game (3-7 minutes)

**Sensory Station Play**: Set up 3-4 stations, child rotates through or chooses stations

**Station 1: Texture Exploration**
- Provide: Different textured items (soft blanket, rough sponge, smooth wooden blocks, silky scarf)
- Activity: Child explores textures with hands, feet, arms; names textures if able ("Soft!" "Rough!")
- Coaching: "Can you find something rough? Now something smooth? Which one feels better to you?"

**Station 2: Pouring and Scooping**
- Provide: Sensory bin with rice/beans/sand, measuring cups, funnels, scoops
- Activity: Child pours, scoops, sifts material; feels texture changing as it moves
- Coaching: "Listen to the sound it makes! Feel it pouring through your fingers!"

**Station 3: Balance Walk**
- Provide: Balance beam, tape line, or foam strip
- Activity: Child walks forward, backward, or sideways along line; maintains balance
- Coaching: "Feel your feet finding the line. Notice how your arms help you balance. You've got this!"

**Station 4: Water or Kinetic Sand Exploration**
- Provide: Shallow pan of water or kinetic sand, various objects to float/sink
- Activity: Child submerges hands, creates patterns, scoops and pours
- Coaching: "How does your hand feel when it's wet? Cool, right? Watch what happens to the sand when it gets water!"

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Gentle hands - we touch softly and carefully
2. Keep sensory materials in the bins (or over the tarp)
3. Stay within your zone so everyone has space

**Variations**:
- Blindfolded texture discovery - child explores with eyes closed, you name the texture
- Texture sorting - child groups similar textures together
- Movement and texture - child walks while dragging hand across different textures
- Sound exploration - add bells, shakers, drums to sensory experience

**Turn-taking** (if applicable): If multiple children, set a timer for 2-3 minutes per station; allow child to return to favorite station at end

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)
Allow child to choose their favorite sensory station and explore without direction
- Observe what captures their interest
- Note which textures and activities they gravitate toward
- Minimize intervention; let them lead discovery
- Join their play if invited

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Transition from active sensory exploration to calm state; process experiences

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Gentle hand and foot wash - "Let's wash off our explorer hands and feet. Feel the warm water? Very gentle."
2. Seated body awareness - "Sit with me. Close your eyes if you want. How does your body feel after all that exploring? Can you feel your heartbeat?"
3. Slow breathing with movement - "Let's breathe together. Breathe in slowly... and out... nice and calm. As you breathe, feel your belly move."

**Transition**: "Our sensory adventure is done now. You discovered so many textures and feelings. Let's take some quiet time to remember what our favorite part was."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years
**Modifications**:
- Simplify stations to 2 instead of 4; remove complex pouring activities
- Use larger objects (no small choking hazards)
- Increase tactile focus; reduce complexity of balance activities
- Shorter duration at each station (1-2 minutes)
- More adult modeling and participation
- Keep instructions very simple, 1-2 words: "Feel!" "Soft!" "Try this!"

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes total activity time

**Adult support**: Very hands-on; join every activity; provide comfort if child feels overwhelmed; guide hand placement

### 3-4+ years
**Challenges to add**:
- Add 4-5 stations; include more complex balance challenges (eyes closed, on one foot)
- Introduce texture description vocabulary: bumpy, smooth, squishy, cold, wet
- Challenge balance beam with speed variations: walk slow, medium, fast
- Add sequencing: "First touch something rough, then find something soft"
- Include drawing or art with textured items (textured painting with brush, stamping with objects)
- Introduce bilateral coordination challenges: pour with both hands, balance with arms in specific positions

**Duration**: Can extend to 15-20 minutes with multiple stations and more complex challenges

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips
- **What to say**: "I notice you're exploring the soft textures. Do you like how that feels? What else would you like to try?" or "Your feet are working so hard to keep you balanced on that line. You're doing great!"
- **What to avoid**: Don't force exploration of textures child finds unpleasant; don't expect balance mastery; avoid comparing child's abilities to others
- **When to help**: Provide physical support during balance activities; model texture exploration; help with hand-washing if needed; step back and observe when child is engaged

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child refuses to touch certain textures or becomes upset
**Why**: Sensory sensitivity is normal; some children have defensive reactions to certain inputs
**Solution**: Never force exploration; acknowledge feeling ("That texture is too much right now, and that's okay"); offer alternative textures; gradually expose with time and repetition
**Timeline**: May improve over weeks; some sensory sensitivities persist and should be respected

**Challenge**: Child struggles with balance beam; falls off frequently or becomes frustrated
**Why**: Vestibular system still developing; requires practice and neural development
**Solution**: Start with line on floor (easier than raised surface); use yoga mat for safety; practice daily; celebrate small improvements; reduce height or width initially
**Timeline**: Improves with consistent practice over several weeks; rapid progress around age 3.5+

**Challenge**: Child wants to eat sensory materials (especially sand, rice, dried goods)
**Why**: Young children explore with mouth as primary sense; developmentally normal
**Solution**: Use food-safe materials; keep non-food materials away from mouth; offer safe alternatives (dried cereal, crackers); supervise constantly; redirect to other senses ("Let's feel it instead")
**Timeline**: Decreases as child moves past mouthing stage; typically by 2.5-3 years for most children

**Challenge**: Child spills sensory materials outside containers repeatedly
**Why**: Fine motor control and coordination still developing; may be testing cause/effect
**Solution**: Use wider, shallower containers; work over tarp; consider that spilling is learning; teach "gentle pouring" with repeated modeling; make cleanup part of the fun
**Timeline**: Improves with practice and maturation of fine motor skills (ongoing into 4+ years)

### Safety Reminders
- Always supervise sensory activities closely, especially water and small objects
- Keep choking hazard materials (small beads, buttons) away from children under 3 unless objects are larger than toilet paper tube opening
- Check that sensory materials are clean and food-safe given your child's tendency to mouth items
- Watch for signs of sensory overload: covering ears, closing eyes tightly, pulling away, crying
- Never force child to participate in activities that cause distress
- Ensure balance activities are on non-slip, safe surfaces with no tripping hazards nearby

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Increased confidence exploring new textures without hesitation
- Better balance; fewer falls or stumbles on balance beam
- Longer duration of engagement at each station (increasing from 1-2 to 3-5 minutes)
- Ability to describe textures or express preferences ("Like soft!" "No, bumpy!")
- More refined hand movements; better control of pouring and scooping
- Ability to follow activity transitions with less adult prompting

**When to add challenge**: When child consistently completes activities without frustration, confidently walks balance beam multiple times, and requests more difficult stations, you can introduce more complex sensory inputs and balance challenges
