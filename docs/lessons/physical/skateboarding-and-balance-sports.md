# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Skateboarding and Balance Sports

## Activity Summary

This activity introduces young children to balance and coordination through safe, age-appropriate balance board experiences. Children learn fundamental balance skills, weight distribution, and body awareness while developing confidence on unstable surfaces. These skills form the foundation for future skateboarding, surfing, and other balance sports while building gross motor strength and proprioceptive awareness.

**Activity Type**: Motor skill development/Individual Sport

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Moderate

**Best Environment**: Indoor gymnasium/Living room with cushioned flooring

**Space Required**: 12x12 feet minimum (clear, open area)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Balance board or wobble board (8-10 inches wide, low platform for safety) - or DIY rocker board
- Soft foam mat or yoga mat (to cushion falls)
- Safety barriers or cones (to define play area)
- Adult spotting hands or soft padding for support

**Optional enhancements**:
- Balance beam or low line on floor (tape or rope) for progression
- Soft blocks or cushions to create varied terrain
- Music or rhythm instruments (to add fun element)
- Visual markers or spots (colorful tape on floor for foot placement)

**DIY alternatives**:
- Rocker board: plywood board with PVC pipe underneath
- Balance challenge: sturdy footstool (very low, with adult supervision)
- Floor tape to create balance lines
- Couch cushions arranged safely for soft surfaces

**Cost estimate**: Free (household items) to Under $20 (budget balance board)

**Safety equipment**:
- Non-slip surface (mat or textured floor)
- Soft padding around board edges
- Adult spotter within arm's reach
- Clear space free of obstacles

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear a large open area of at least 12x12 feet
2. Place soft mat underneath and around balance board
3. Position any safety barriers at edges of play space
4. Remove any hard objects, sharp corners, or obstacles
5. Ensure adult has clear view of entire activity area
6. Test balance board stability before child uses it

**Boundaries**:
- Clearly define play area with cones or tape
- Keep water bottles and toys outside boundary
- Establish that child stays within mat area during balance work

**Safety considerations**:
- Child must be spotted at all times - adult within arm's reach for assistance
- Start with very low balance devices or floor work before elevated boards
- Ensure non-slip surface on board (add grip tape if needed)
- Stop immediately if child shows fear or instability
- Footwear: soft shoes or socks with grip (no slippery soles)
- Never force balance work - let confidence build naturally

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare muscles for balance work and establish body awareness

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Marching in place - lift knees high, swing arms gently (demonstrates weight shifting)
2. Side-to-side swaying - stand with feet hip-width apart, sway like trees in wind
3. Standing on one leg practice - hold balance for 3-5 seconds, switch legs, no board yet

**Warm-up cues**:
- "Let's march like we're walking through a big puddle - lift those feet high!"
- "Now sway like a tall tree in the breeze - back and forth, back and forth"
- "Can you stand on one leg like a flamingo? Hold it... hold it... great job!"

### Main Activity (8-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Show the balance board and explain it's "wobbly like water" - it moves side to side
- Demonstrate adult standing on board (briefly) to show it's safe and what happens
- Explain we're learning to keep our balance by moving our body gently
- Key coaching point: "This board is like a boat - we use our arms to help us balance"

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:

1. **Standing on the board with support**
   - Child stands on board while holding adult's hands or a stable rail
   - Practice feeling the board wobble beneath feet
   - Adult provides reassurance and stability

2. **Weight shifting and balance**
   - Practice small movements side to side (adult holds hands)
   - Rock forward and back gently
   - Feel how body adjusts to keep balance

3. **Independent standing (with spotting)**
   - Child stands on board with adult's hand nearby (not held, but ready)
   - Practice finding center of balance
   - Build confidence with each successful moment

**Coaching cues**:
- "Keep your knees a little bit soft and bendy - like springs!"
- "Look ahead at me, not down at your feet"
- "Spread your arms out like airplane wings to help you balance"
- "Good - feel the board moving? That's what we want!"
- "You're a surfer riding the waves!"

#### Guided Play/Game (3-7 minutes)

**Game structure**: Transform balance practice into playful movement games

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Always stay on the mat (safe landing zone)
2. Adult spotter stays very close
3. Feet stay on the board - don't jump off

**Variations**:

- **Wave Rider**: Child balances while adult gently rocks the board side to side (like surfing waves)
- **Balance Challenge**: Can you balance while touching your toes? Reaching up high? Making shapes with your arms?
- **Flamingo Stand**: Try standing on one foot while on the board (with lots of adult support)
- **Count and Balance**: Count how many seconds you can stand steady (make it a fun challenge, not pressure)

**Turn-taking** (if multiple children):
- One child on board while others do warm-up movements nearby
- Keep turns short (30-45 seconds) to maintain interest
- Celebrate each child's turn with cheering and encouragement

#### Free Exploration (1-2 minutes)
- Allow child to experiment with balance movements without instruction
- Try different arm positions to see what helps
- Discover balance by moving naturally
- Let child get on and off the board as desired to build confidence

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Slow movement and reflect on accomplishment

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Gentle swaying in place - slow side-to-side movement with arms down
2. Deep breathing - "breathe in like you smell flowers, breathe out like you blow bubbles"
3. Lying down for body awareness - what body parts feel tingly or warm?

**Transition**:
- "Great balancing today! Now let's calm our bodies down"
- Move from active board work to quiet floor sitting
- Sit together and talk about what worked and how it felt

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Focus on floor-based balance work before introducing board
- Practice standing on one foot on solid ground first
- Very short balance board time (15-30 seconds per attempt)
- Heavy adult spotting and hand-holding required
- Use extremely low, very stable board or rocker board
- Accept that falling/slipping is normal and okay
- Emphasize exploration over skill performance

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes total (frequent breaks for other activities)

**Adult support**:
- Hands-on spotting during all board work
- Constant verbal encouragement
- Be prepared for quick transitions if child loses interest
- Allow multiple attempts with reassurance each time

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Longer balance hold times (aim for 5-10 seconds unassisted)
- Arm movements while balancing (reach, touch sides, hold objects)
- Two-footed to one-footed transitions
- Gentle rocking motion of board
- Attempt turning or shifting weight more deliberately
- Add visual targets to focus on (dot on wall, adult's eyes)
- Low balance beams or lines on floor for progression
- Brief independent standing (within arm's reach)

**Duration**: Can extend to 15-20 minutes with multiple activities

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**: "You're doing such a great job discovering how to balance! Your body is learning something new." or "See how your arms help you stay steady? That's smart!"
- **What to avoid**: "Don't fall!" or "Be careful!" (creates fear response), comparing to other children, expecting perfection
- **When to help**: Help when child asks, or when they're about to lose balance and fall hard. Let them experience small wobbles and corrections

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is fearful of the wobbly board

**Why**: Young children are developing their sense of balance and safety. Unknown sensations can feel threatening.

**Solution**: Start on solid ground with balance work. Let child watch you or older children use board first. Gradually introduce board with maximum adult support. Use language like "the board is like a toy that moves" rather than "you need to balance."

**Timeline**: Fear typically decreases over 2-3 sessions as child becomes familiar with sensation

---

**Challenge**: Child keeps wanting to jump off the board

**Why**: Young children test limits and may feel uncertain about foot placement. Jumping feels safer than balancing.

**Solution**: Allow them to step off rather than jump (safer for landing). Celebrate successful standing time. Keep sessions very short so they want more. Make it a game: "Can you stand for 3 counts? Let's try!"

**Timeline**: As confidence builds (1-2 weeks), children naturally spend more time on board

---

**Challenge**: Child struggles with balance or seems clumsy

**Why**: Balance development varies greatly. Some children need more practice with proprioception. This is completely normal.

**Solution**: Increase frequency of short sessions rather than long ones. Practice floor-based balance activities daily (standing on one foot, dancing, etc.). Be patient with development. Consider that confidence matters more than immediate skill.

**Timeline**: Significant improvement typically visible over 4-6 weeks with regular practice

---

**Challenge**: Child wants to do it alone but isn't ready

**Why**: Young children have limited awareness of their balance capabilities and want independence.

**Solution**: Offer graduated independence - hand-hold to finger-hold to nearby spotting. Celebrate each level. "You're getting so strong and brave! Soon you'll barely need my hand."

**Timeline**: Most 3-4 year-olds can manage 5-10 seconds of balance with nearby spotting by week 3-4

### Safety Reminders
- Adult must maintain arm's reach spotting at all times during this activity
- Check board stability and non-slip surface before each use
- Stop immediately if child shows genuine fear or distress - don't push
- Ensure soft landing surfaces surrounding balance board (2-3 feet in all directions)
- Watch for signs of fatigue (wobbly stance, loss of focus) and take breaks
- If child falls, check for injuries but don't make it a big dramatic event - normalize it as learning

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Increased time standing on board (15 seconds → 30 seconds → 1+ minute)
- Less dependence on adult's hand support
- Better body positioning (knees slightly bent, upright posture)
- Use of arms for balance adjustment
- Willingness to try again after wobbling
- Reduced fear response over time

**When to add challenge**:
- When child can stand for 10+ seconds with minimal support, try arm movements
- When they show confidence, try one-foot balance on solid ground first
- When they request "harder" activities, introduce balance beam or gentle movement variations
