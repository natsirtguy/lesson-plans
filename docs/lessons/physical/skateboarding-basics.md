# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Skateboarding Basics

## Activity Summary

Skateboarding basics introduces young children to standing on a skateboard and pushing with one foot, building balance, leg strength, and spatial awareness. This activity focuses on comfort and confidence with the board as an object and gentle movement rather than tricks or complex skills. Skateboarding develops proprioception and core stability while being inherently fun and exciting for children.

**Activity Type**: Motor skill development/Outdoor adventure

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes (with frequent breaks)

**Energy Level**: Moderate

**Best Environment**: Smooth paved area, skateboard park beginners' area, or gymnasium

**Space Required**: Large open area (40x20 feet minimum, flat and smooth)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Small skateboard or skateboard trainer (20-24 inches long, 7-8 inches wide) - designed for young children, lower to ground
- Properly fitted helmet - CPSC or ASTM certified skateboard helmet
- Wrist guards, elbow pads, and knee pads - highly recommended protective gear set
- Smooth, flat, even paved surface - smooth asphalt or gymnasium floor (not bumpy or textured)

**Optional enhancements**:
- Skateboard ramps (very small, 2-3 feet long, 6-12 inch incline) - for older, more experienced children only
- Cones or markers (12-18 inches) - to mark path or landing zones
- Foam mats - to cushion falls in gymnasium setting
- Balance bar or barre - to hold for stability while learning
- Skateboard with wider platform - extra stability for beginners

**DIY alternatives**:
- None recommended for skateboarding - professional boards are safest option
- Cannot safely DIY a skateboard for young children

**Cost estimate**: $40-80 (child skateboard trainer) / $20-40 (quality helmet and pads)

**Safety equipment**:
- Helmet (MUST have) - skateboard-specific helmet, properly fitted and fastened
- Wrist guards - critical for protecting growing bones
- Elbow pads - protects joints and arms
- Knee pads - protects knees from scrapes and impact
- Closed-toe shoes with good ankle support - no sandals or loose footwear

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Select completely flat, smooth, even paved surface with no bumps, cracks, or debris
2. Test surface by rolling skateboard - should roll smoothly with minimal resistance
3. Clear area of obstacles, rocks, sticks, water, toys, and other hazards
4. Inspect skateboard: wheels spin freely, board has no cracks, grip tape is not slippery
5. Check all protective gear fits properly and fastens securely
6. Have water and first aid kit accessible nearby
7. Position yourself for clear visibility of entire play area

**Boundaries**:
- Mark a rectangular riding zone (40x20 feet minimum) using cones or chalk lines
- Keep boundaries well away from traffic, slopes, or hazards
- Designate "pushing off zone" separate from "skating zone" if possible
- Create clear boundary for walking alongside (not on skateboard)

**Safety considerations**:
- **Risk: Uncontrolled speed or momentum** - Mitigation: Practice only on completely flat surfaces; teach foot-dragging as braking; no ramps or slopes until age 5+
- **Risk: Falling from skateboard** - Mitigation: Full protective gear non-negotiable; practice stationary balance first; start with pushing practice
- **Risk: Skateboard rolling away** - Mitigation: Ensure adequate grip tape; teach foot placement; always supervise closely
- **Risk: Collision with others** - Mitigation: Clear area of other children; use wide, open space; establish simple traffic patterns
- **Risk: Impact injuries to head or joints** - Mitigation: Non-negotiable helmet and pad use; monitor for landing on outstretched hands (common fall pattern)
- **Risk: Overexertion fatigue** - Mitigation: Frequent breaks every 3-5 minutes; watch for loss of focus or wobbly balance

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare leg muscles and balance systems; build excitement and focus; prepare for weight-shifting movements

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Marching in place (30 seconds) - "Let's march like we're getting ready to skateboard!"
2. Balance on each leg (20 seconds per leg) - "Stand on one foot, then the other"
3. Side-to-side weight shifts (40 seconds) - "Shift your weight left and right, back and forth"
4. Gentle leg swings (30 seconds) - "Swing one leg forward and back, then the other"
5. Reaching and stretching (30 seconds) - "Stretch your arms up high and to the sides"

**Warm-up cues**:
- "Our legs are waking up and ready to skateboard!"
- "Feel balanced and strong - we're preparing for the board"
- "Easy movements, getting our bodies ready"

### Main Activity (12-16 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Show the skateboard and identify key parts: deck, wheels, grip tape, tail
- Demonstrate proper helmet fit and fastening
- Show all protective gear in place
- Demonstrate proper stance: feet shoulder-width apart, slightly bent knees, arms out for balance
- Explain that we're learning to push and ride, not do tricks
- Model stepping on and off safely

#### Skill Practice - Board Familiarity (2-3 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
- **Approaching the board**: Walk slowly to board, making no sudden movements
- **Board orientation**: Know which way is front and back of board
- **Stepping on**: Place one foot securely on middle/back of board, holding balance support
- **Two-foot standing**: Stand on board with both feet shoulder-width apart, arms out for balance
- **Stepping off**: Step backward or sideways off board slowly

**Coaching cues**:
- "Walk slowly to the board - no rush"
- "Put your feet apart on the board for balance - like a superhero standing tall"
- "Feet in the middle, arms out like a tightrope walker"
- "To get off, step backward slowly - nice and easy"

#### Guided Skateboarding - Assisted (3-5 minutes)

**Activity structure**:
1. **Stationary balance practice** (1 minute) - Child stands on board with adult providing hand support
2. **Slow rolling with support** (2-3 minutes) - Adult pushes board gently (very slowly) while child stands and balances
3. **Learning to step on and off** (1 minute) - Multiple repetitions of mounting and dismounting safely

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Helmet stays on the entire time
2. Always hold adult's hand or support
3. Move slowly - we are not racing
4. When you hear "stop," we slow down gently
5. Stay in the marked area

**Variations**:
- Adult pushes board very gently while child stands
- Child holds railing or balance bar while walking skateboard slowly
- Child stands on skateboard while holding onto fence or adult hands
- Very short assisted "rides" (just 5-10 feet)

**Turn-taking** (if multiple children):
- 2-3 minute turns per child
- Non-riding children can be "cheerleaders" or help with equipment
- Set timer for predictable transitions

#### Skill Practice - Self-Propulsion (2-3 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
- **Stance**: One foot on board (back or middle), other foot for pushing ground
- **Balance position**: Arms out for balance, knees slightly bent
- **Pushing motion**: Push off ground gently with non-board foot
- **Continuing**: Place pushing foot back on board once rolling
- **Stopping**: Drag pushing foot on ground to slow and stop

**Coaching cues**:
- "Put one foot on the board and one foot on the ground"
- "Give a gentle push with your ground foot"
- "Now put both feet on the board and ride"
- "To stop, drag your foot on the ground - easy and gentle"
- "Keep your arms out for balance"

#### Guided Free Practice (2-3 minutes)
- Child attempts self-propelled skating with adult close by for safety
- Practice short distances (10-20 feet)
- Celebrate attempts and effort
- Multiple short tries work better than one long attempt

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Bring heart rate down; calm nervous system; reflect on accomplishment

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow walking around area (1 minute) - "Let's take a nice, slow walk"
2. Gentle stretching (1 minute) - "Stretch your legs after that hard work"
3. Sitting rest and hydration (1 minute) - "Let's sit and rest"

**Transition**:
- "You did an amazing job trying skateboarding! Let's rest now"
- Remove helmet; wipe sweat with cool cloth
- Offer water and celebrate: "You stood on that board and rode it!"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Focus on skateboard as stationary object first - getting comfortable standing on it
- Very short sessions with frequent breaks
- Heavy adult support throughout - hand-holding, supporting balance
- Only stationary balance and very gentle assisted rolling
- Do not attempt self-propulsion; focus on comfort with the board
- May be more comfortable with skateboard trainer (wider, more stable)

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes total

**Adult support**:
- Hold child's hand or hands throughout activity
- Provide constant verbal encouragement and reassurance
- Be ready to catch/support if balance is lost
- Multiple very short attempts (2-3 minutes with 2-3 minute breaks) work better
- Many 2-3 year olds may not be developmentally ready for skateboarding; this is normal

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Progress to self-propulsion and gentle rolling
- Longer sessions with shorter breaks
- Reduce hand support as balance improves
- Practice more consistent pushing and riding
- Introduce gentle turns in open space
- May attempt stopping with foot-dragging
- Increased ride distances (20-30 feet)
- More independent practice with adult supervision nearby

**Duration**: Can extend to 20 minutes with regular short breaks

**Additional skills**:
- Better balance and proprioception
- Smoother pushing motion and transitions
- More confident stepping on/off board
- Improved ability to stop and control speed

## Extension Ideas

### Progression Pathways
1. **From stationary to slow rolling** - Master standing still on board before attempting movement
2. **From assisted to independent riding** - Gradually reduce adult hand support as balance improves
3. **From small boards to standard boards** - Start with skateboard trainer, graduate to regular skateboard as skills improve

### Creative Variations
- **"Skateboard delivery service"** - Ride to different locations to "deliver" items
- **"Obstacle course"** - Simple path to follow while riding (gentle curves, not sharp turns)
- **"Target zones"** - Mark cones or hula hoops; practice rolling to different zones
- **"Balance challenge"** - How long can you stand on the skateboard?
- **"Slow motion skateboarding"** - Who can ride the slowest?

### Social Play
- Multiple children learning together (with separate space for each)
- Cheering and encouragement from non-riding children
- Taking turns and celebrating attempts
- Skateboard "parade" where children ride slowly in line with adult support

### Skill Integration
- Use skateboarding as transport to other activities (very short distances)
- Combine with other balance activities (balance board, scooter)
- Practice transitions: stepping on and off smoothly
- Build to longer rides and more independent control

## Safety and Supervision

### Constant Supervision Requirements
- **Never leave child unattended** while near skateboard
- Adult must be within arm's reach for ages 2-3
- Adult must be close enough to intervene immediately if balance is lost
- Watch for signs of fatigue or loss of focus

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

**What to say**:
- "You're standing on that skateboard! Great balance!"
- "I can see you're working hard and learning"
- "Each time you try, you get more confident"
- "It's okay if you feel wobbly - that's how balance works"

**What to avoid**:
- "Don't fall!" or fear-based language
- Comparing to other children
- Forcing continued practice when child wants to stop
- Expressing frustration about slow progress
- Pushing too quickly to advanced skills

**When to help**:
- Provide hand support for balance throughout learning
- Hold both hands if child is unsteady
- Spot closely during attempts
- Let child find their own balance once confident - don't "save" them constantly
- Step back gradually as balance improves

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is afraid of the skateboard or refuses to get on it
**Why**: Fear is normal; some children are cautious learners; falling is a real possibility
**Solution**: Let child sit on board while stationary first; practice stepping on and off without movement; build confidence with hand-holding; use reassuring language; never force - go at child's pace; may need several sessions just on comfort
**Timeline**: Building comfort typically takes 1-2 weeks of short sessions

**Challenge**: Child cannot balance on skateboard or wobbles significantly
**Why**: Balance and proprioception are still developing; core strength may not be adequate yet
**Solution**: Use skateboard trainer with wider platform; keep hand-contact support longer; practice stationary balance before movement; focus on having fun, not skill mastery; this will improve with maturation and practice
**Timeline**: Most children develop skateboard comfort by age 3.5-4+ years

**Challenge**: Child cannot push off ground or coordinate stepping on/off skateboard
**Why**: Coordination and sequencing complex movements takes practice; this is developmentally appropriate
**Solution**: Demonstrate slowly multiple times; practice the motion without skateboard first; break into smaller steps; celebrate tiny attempts; be patient - this will develop naturally
**Timeline**: Better coordination develops between ages 3-5 years

**Challenge**: Child gets scared when skateboard moves even slightly
**Why**: Sensation of movement and loss of control triggers fear response; this is normal
**Solution**: Start with stationary balance only; practice with extremely gentle movement (adult pushing very slowly); return to easier version without shame; build slowly; reassurance and patience are key
**Timeline**: Comfort with movement builds over weeks; this is not a skill deficit, just fear management

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Can step onto skateboard without assistance
- Can stand on skateboard for 5+ seconds without falling
- Can stand on skateboard with minimal adult hand support
- Attempts to push off ground (even if unsuccessful initially)
- Makes fewer wobbles and recovers better from balance loss
- Can step off skateboard safely and controlled
- Shows excitement or requests more skateboarding time
- Expresses less fear and more confidence each session
- Can hold stationary position for 10-15 seconds independently

**Progression over weeks/months**:
- Week 1-2: Focus on comfort; standing on board stationary; getting used to protective gear
- Week 3-4: Can stand with less hand support; beginning to attempt stepping on/off
- Week 5-6: Standing on board becoming more confident; attempting short rides with support
- Week 7-8: Pushing and riding short distances; balance improving noticeably
- Week 9-10: More independent riding; better control and coordination

**When to add challenge**:
- Child can stand on skateboard for 10+ seconds without significant wobbling
- Child shows confidence and less fear
- Child initiates skateboarding practice
- Child can step on and off successfully multiple times
- Adult hand support no longer needed for balance in stationary position

### Protective Gear Maintenance
- Check gear fit frequently - children grow quickly
- Replace any pads showing wear or damage
- Wash gear periodically (protective pads can be washed in water)
- Ensure all straps and fasteners remain tight throughout activity
- Replace helmet if ever in significant impact
- Keep gear clean and dry between sessions
- Inspect skateboard regularly for damage

### Important Note for Very Young Children
Skateboarding for ages 2-3 is primarily about comfort and familiarity with the board. Full self-propulsion and independent skating typically develops between ages 4-6 years. This is normal and developmental - focus on fun and building positive associations with the activity rather than skill mastery.
