# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Surfing and Wave Riding

## Activity Summary

Surfing and wave riding introduce young children to balance, wave awareness, and water dynamics through beginner-friendly activities in shallow beach water or using specialized floating devices. This activity builds core stability, body awareness, proprioception, and introduces ocean literacy and water confidence. It's beneficial for developing balance, coordination, resilience through falls, and connection to natural water environments.

**Activity Type**: Aquatic Sport / Outdoor Adventure

**Duration**: 12-18 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: High

**Best Environment**: Beach with gentle waves, pool with wave machine, or indoor facility with shallow water and flotation boards

**Space Required**: Large open water area (at least 20x20 feet of clear water)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Child-sized soft-top surfboard or bodyboard (3-5 feet long, lightweight foam)
- Leash or wrist strap (safety connection to board)
- Swim vest or flotation device for non-swimmers
- Rash guard or shirt (sun protection)
- Waterproof sunscreen
- Non-slip water shoes or sandals
- Large towels and dry clothes

**Optional enhancements**:
- Kickboard or flotation noodle for balance practice
- Flotation belts
- Paddling fins or booties
- Waterproof watch for timing
- Underwater camera
- Beach umbrellas for shade breaks

**DIY alternatives**: Foam cooler lid, large inflatable raft, body surfing (no board), paddleboard with handholds, boogie board substitute

**Cost estimate**: Under $10 if using household flotation items; $20-50 for budget soft-top board

**Safety equipment**: Coast Guard approved life jacket, rescue tube, first aid kit, shade structure, fresh water for rinsing

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Choose beach or water area with gentle waves (2-3 feet maximum)
2. Check tide and water conditions (calm, no strong currents)
3. Inspect seabed for rocks, shells, or hazards
4. Set up shade structure (umbrella or tent)
5. Place all equipment in organized area above water line
6. Mark entry and exit points clearly
7. Check water temperature (at least 70 degrees F)

**Boundaries**: Use bright floating markers or flags to define safe practicing area; establish clear boundary for "too deep"

**Safety considerations**:
- Maintain constant adult supervision - never leave child unattended in water
- Use life jacket or flotation device for all non-swimmers
- Ensure leash is properly attached to prevent board loss
- Watch for rip currents or changing water conditions
- Check UV index and apply sunscreen frequently
- Monitor for signs of cold (shivering, lethargy, pale lips)
- Establish clear "exit water immediately" signals
- Ensure certified lifeguard present at public beaches
- Have rescue equipment within immediate reach
- Be aware of other water users (swimmers, boats)

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Build body awareness, establish balance, prepare muscles for paddling and balancing

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Balance walking on shore - "Walk like a tightrope walker, arms out for balance"
2. Arm circles and shoulder rotations - "Make big windmill circles with your arms"
3. Jumping and lunging on sand - "Jump in the soft sand, feel it under your feet"

**Warm-up cues**: "We're going to ride waves like surfers! First, let's get our bodies ready and warm up"

### Main Activity (8-13 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- Show the surfboard and explain how waves push it
- Demonstrate the basic surf position: lying flat with hands near board edge
- Show how to paddle with arms
- Explain that they'll start in very shallow water

#### Skill Practice (3-4 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
1. **Board handling**: Holding the board, dragging it, feeling its flotation
2. **Paddle position**: Lying flat on belly, arms extended for paddling
3. **Paddling strokes**: Alternating arm movements to move board forward
4. **Wave awareness**: Recognizing approaching waves, positioning body
5. **Balancing on board**: Keeping center of gravity centered, arms wide for stability

**Coaching cues**:
- "Hold the board like a teddy bear"
- "Lay flat on your board like you're at the beach napping"
- "Paddle with your arms like you're swimming, one arm then the other"
- "Keep your balance by spreading your arms wide like airplane wings"
- "Look where you want to go - the wave will carry you"

#### Guided Play/Game (3-5 minutes)

**Game structure**: "Wave Riders" - Children float on boards in shallow water, riding gentle waves

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Stay on the board or hold onto it
2. Only practice in shallow water where you can stand
3. Help each other if someone falls off
4. Ride the waves when they come

**Variations**:
- Paddling race: "Paddle to the marker as fast as you can"
- Wave count: "How many waves can you ride without falling off?"
- Balance challenge: "Lie still on the board and let the wave rock you"
- Partner paddles: Adult paddles child on board together
- Body surfing: No board, body moves with wave motion

**Turn-taking** (if applicable): If limited equipment, take turns with board; others practice balance or body surfing

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

Let child experiment with paddling, balancing, and riding waves at their own pace
- Encourage them to find comfortable positions
- Allow exploration of falling and getting back on board
- Support them in trying different paddling speeds
- Let them enjoy the sensation of floating

### Cool-Down (1-2 minutes)

**Purpose**: Exit water safely, warm body, transition to rest, prevent chill

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow wade to shore with adult - "Walk slowly back to the beach"
2. Wrap in towel and sit in shade - "Get warm and cozy in your towel"
3. Rinse off with fresh water and rest - "Let's rest and drink some water"

**Transition**: "You were amazing wave riders today! Let's rest and dry off in the shade"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Use boogie board or very small, extremely stable board
- Adult holds child on board in very shallow water
- Focus on floating and feeling water movement rather than paddling
- Shorter active periods (5-8 minutes) with frequent rest breaks
- Use floatation devices liberally (life jacket, noodles)
- Emphasize play and sensation over technique
- Allow child to control participation level
- Practice on completely flat water first if possible

**Duration**: 8-10 minutes total

**Adult support**: Constant physical support on board, holding child secure, demonstrating movements

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Paddling independently with adult nearby
- Deeper water and slightly larger waves
- Extended time on board without adult support
- Coordinated paddling with timing
- Introduction to standing position (if confident swimmers)
- Longer wave-riding sequences
- Multiple paddling strokes before wave contact

**Duration**: Can extend to 18-20 minutes with longer active periods

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**: "Look at you floating on that board! You're riding the wave like a real surfer! Great balance - you're doing amazing!"
- **What to avoid**: Don't create performance pressure; avoid negative comments about falling (it's part of learning)
- **When to help**: Hold them securely on board initially, guide arm movements, but gradually reduce support as confidence builds

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is afraid of waves or falls off and gets scared
**Why**: Unexpected water motion, loss of control, or swallowing water can be frightening; fear response is normal
**Solution**: Start in very calm water, make falling a game ("splash contest"), stay calm when they fall, celebrate getting back on
**Timeline**: Most children overcome this within 3-4 sessions with patient encouragement

**Challenge**: Child can't balance on board or keeps slipping off
**Why**: Core stability and proprioception are still developing; boards can be slippery; children have higher center of gravity
**Solution**: Use wider, more stable boards; practice balance on shore first; keep children in water where they can touch bottom; use board with handles
**Timeline**: Balance improves significantly by age 4 with practice; most comfortable by age 4+

**Challenge**: Child gets water up the nose or in eyes and becomes upset
**Why**: Saltwater irritates, unexpected splashes startle, vision disruption is disorienting
**Solution**: Use goggles if tolerated, teach to blow out nose, practice in calmer water, keep transitions gentle
**Timeline**: Gets easier as they learn to anticipate and control breathing

### Safety Reminders

- Never leave child unattended in water - maintain constant arm's reach supervision
- Ensure child wears properly fitted life jacket if not a strong swimmer
- Leash must be attached to child's wrist and board securely
- Check water conditions: temperature, waves, currents before entering
- Apply waterproof sunscreen frequently (UV protection critical)
- Watch for signs of cold: shivering, chattering teeth, lethargy
- Ensure clear communication signals for "exit water now"
- Be aware of tides and their changes during session
- Know location of nearest lifeguard
- Have rescue equipment (flotation device) immediately available
- Rinse with fresh water after saltwater to prevent skin irritation

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Maintains prone position on board without slipping
- Paddles with coordinated arm movements
- Shows increased confidence in shallow water
- Recovers from falling quickly and independently
- Recognizes approaching waves and positions appropriately
- Can float and balance on board with minimal adult support
- Demonstrates improved proprioception and body awareness

**When to add challenge**: When child comfortably paddles to a marker and handles simple waves, introduce slightly deeper water or larger gentle waves
