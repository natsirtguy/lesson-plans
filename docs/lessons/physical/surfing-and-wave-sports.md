# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Surfing and Wave Sports

## Activity Summary

Surfing and wave sports introduce children to water-based athletic activities that build balance, core strength, and water confidence — and they offer a direct encounter with real physics. **Waves are not water moving toward shore — they are energy moving through water.** The water molecules mostly move in circles as a wave passes; it's the energy that travels. Waves are generated by wind friction over the ocean surface, often hundreds or thousands of miles away, and they carry that energy until they reach shallow water and break. When children lie on a foam surfboard and feel a swell lift them, they're experiencing buoyancy (the upward force water exerts on less-dense objects) and wave energy simultaneously. Caregivers should name these things during the activity — not as lectures, but as real descriptions of what's happening: "Feel that? The energy from far away in the ocean just reached us."

**Activity Type**: Water sport and aquatic adventure activity

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (including water entry, lesson, and rest)

**Energy Level**: High

**Best Environment**: Beach with calm waves, supervised water areas, wave pools, or calm water bodies

**Space Required**: Safe water zone with gradual depth (minimum 10-20 feet wide clear water area)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Size-appropriate surfboard or soft beginner board (3-5 feet length, soft foam) - safe for beginners
- Life jacket or properly fitted personal flotation device (PFD) - mandatory safety gear
- Rash guard or swim shirt - sun protection and thermal insulation
- Swim trunks or board shorts - appropriate for water activity
- Towels (multiple, large absorbent) - for drying off
- Sunscreen (child-safe, SPF 50+) - essential sun protection
- Water safety equipment: flotation buoys, rescue ring - emergency access

**Optional enhancements**:
- Wetsuit (age-appropriate thickness) - for cooler water temperature
- Water shoes - protection from sharp rocks or shells
- Waterproof bag - for belongings
- Boogie board or kickboard - progression tool
- Wave pool day pass - alternative to ocean
- Inflatable float - additional flotation safety

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use child-sized kickboards for beginning paddling practice
- Substitute PFD with quality life jacket from any water sport retailer
- Use household towels instead of specialized beach towels
- Create rash guard substitute with regular swim shirt
- Find calm, shallow water instead of seeking waves (lake, bay, calm beach)

**Cost estimate**: $20-50 for life jacket and rash guard; surfboard rental $5-15 per day

**Safety equipment**:
- Life jacket is MANDATORY - not optional
- Sunscreen essential for skin protection
- Flotation devices for deeper water
- Rescue equipment at beach

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Scout the water area: check water temperature, wave height, current strength
2. Verify water quality and safety conditions
3. Establish entry and exit points - easy access to deeper water
4. Identify any hazards: rocks, coral, sharp shells, currents
5. Mark safe play zone with boundaries visible from shore
6. Ensure clear supervisor positioning with view of entire water area
7. Have rescue equipment accessible on shore
8. Check weather: watch for sudden changes, storm risk

**Boundaries**:
- Clear water zone markers (rope, buoys, or visible landmarks)
- Shallow water area for beginning practice
- Deeper water zone for more experienced participants
- No go zones (rocks, currents, deep drop-offs)
- Shore-based supervisor position with clear sightline

**Safety considerations**:
- Life jacket MUST be worn by all children in/near water
- Never leave child unattended in or near water
- Constant adult supervision within arm's reach or immediate visual contact
- Check water temperature - avoid cold water causing hypothermia risk
- Watch for strong currents or rip tides
- Sun exposure limited - frequent breaks in shade
- Dehydration risk in sun - frequent fresh water breaks
- Sharp marine life or shells - water shoes recommended
- Only in designated safe swimming areas
- Know rescue procedures and have first aid kit available

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare muscles for water activity, build excitement, establish water safety awareness

**Warm-up activities** (BEFORE entering water):
1. Walking and light jogging on shore - "Let's get our muscles warm and ready"
2. Arm circles, shoulder rolls, and torso twists - "Loosen up your arms"
3. Leg stretches and lunges - "Prepare your legs for paddling"

**Warm-up cues**:
- "Check your life jacket - is it buckled securely? That keeps you safe!"
- "We're going to play in the water where waves move and splash"
- "Stay where the water is calm so you can have fun and stay safe"

### Main Activity (12-20 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2-3 minutes)
- Explain that surfing means catching energy that traveled through the ocean to reach you
- Introduce wave physics simply: "Waves are not water rushing toward us — they're energy moving through water. The water mostly stays in place; it's the energy that travels, sometimes from thousands of miles away." Have the child wave their hand in a tub of water and watch the ripples — those ripples are energy moving through water, not water moving across the room.
- Explain buoyancy: "Why does our foam board float? Because it's less heavy for its size than water. Water pushes UP on things that are less dense. That upward push is called buoyancy — and it's what holds us up."
- Show how to lie on the board, paddle with arms, and fall safely

#### Skill Practice (4-8 minutes)

**Paddling and board handling skill breakdown**:
- Paddling position: lying on belly on board, face forward
- Paddling motion: alternating arm strokes like swimming
- Balance: weight centered on board
- Holding on: firm but safe grip on board edges
- Getting up: hands press down, arms straighten, feet under body

**Balance and stability skill breakdown**:
- Core engagement: keeping body stable on unstable surface
- Head position: eyes forward, looking where you're going
- Arm position: used for balance and paddle
- Leg position: feet under you for push-off

**Water comfort and navigation skill breakdown**:
- Entering water: walk in slowly, hold board
- Moving in water: paddling, floating, changing direction
- Exiting water: stand up, walk out with board

**Coaching cues**:
- "Paddle like you're swimming — reach and pull with your arms"
- "Keep your eyes forward and your body flat on the board"
- "Use your core muscles to stay balanced — your core is what connects everything"
- "Feel the water pushing up on you? That's buoyancy — the water is holding you up"
- "Here comes a wave — that's energy from far away in the ocean reaching us right now"
- "Fall off gently — the water will catch you!"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-10 minutes)

**Game structure**: Progress from water comfort to board control to wave riding

**Beginner activities (shallow water)**:
- Floating on board with adult support - building water comfort
- Paddling on board in calm water - practicing arm movements
- Standing on stable board in shallow water - developing balance
- Walking with board in water - getting comfortable with equipment
- Floating on back with life jacket - relaxation and trust

**Intermediate activities (moving water)**:
- Paddling to markers or targets - directional control
- Riding gentle rolling waves on board - experiencing wave movement
- Standing and balancing on board in calm water - stability practice
- Simple wave catch practice - timing and positioning
- Partner paddling - going together with another child

**Wave riding activities (with waves)**:
- Catching small waves on board with adult support - learning to pop up
- Riding waves in to shore - experiencing the thrill
- Timing waves - learning when to paddle and catch
- Directional control on waves - steering on board
- Building confidence with bigger movements

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Life jacket on at all times when in or near water
2. Stay where you can touch the bottom or are with an adult
3. Keep your board close to you
4. If you fall off, get back on or paddle to shore

**Variations**:
- For younger/less confident: more shallow water, more adult contact, kickboard instead of surfboard
- For older/more confident: longer paddling distances, attempt wave catches, more independent movement
- Calm water version: kayaking, paddling, floating games
- Boogie board instead of surfboard: easier for younger children
- Wave pool version: controlled environment with consistent waves

**Turn-taking**:
- All children can be in water simultaneously with adequate supervision
- If space is limited, rotate groups into water for 10-minute sessions
- Waiting groups practice board skills on shore or play water-safe games

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

Let children experiment with water and board:
- Paddle at their own pace
- Try falling off in safe ways
- Experiment with balance positions
- Build confidence through play

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually exit water, reduce excitement, begin drying and warming process

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow, easy paddling toward shore - "Let's head back in slowly"
2. Standing in shallow water, calm movements - "Feel your body calming down"
3. Walking out of water - careful exit with board

**Transition**:
- "Great job in the water - you were so brave and strong!"
- "Let's dry off and warm up under the shade"
- "Drink some fresh water - swimming makes you thirsty"

## Age Adaptations

## Safety and Supervision

### Active Supervision Requirements
- One adult per 1-2 children in the water (stricter ratio than land activities)
- Constant visual contact - never look away
- Adult should be in water with children or on shore with unobstructed view
- Watch water conditions continuously - waves, currents, weather changes
- Be immediately ready to assist any child

### Common Injury Prevention
- Life jacket MANDATORY at all times - no exceptions
- Water shoes prevent cuts from rocks/shells
- Rash guard prevents sun and abrasion damage
- No jewelry or goggles that could catch on board
- Proper sunscreen reapplication every 2 hours
- Enter water gradually - check temperature with child
- Practice falling technique before encountering real wipeouts
- Know water current directions and avoid rip tides
- Check ocean/water conditions before entering

### Hypothermia and Fatigue Safety
- Session limit: 20-30 minutes in water
- Watch for shivering, cold complaints, loss of coordination
- Exit water immediately if child shows cold symptoms
- Dry off completely and put on warm clothing
- Provide warm (non-hot) beverages after session
- Watch for fatigue: reduced coordination, slow responses
- Provide rest breaks in shade every 10-15 minutes
- Monitor sun exposure - frequent shade breaks essential

### When to Modify or Stop
- Water temperature is too cold (below 65°F typically too cold for young children)
- Weather is threatening: dark clouds, lightning risk, strong winds
- Water conditions dangerous: high waves, strong currents, rough conditions
- Child shows signs of cold: shivering, blue lips, coordination loss
- Child shows fatigue: struggling to move, slow responses, disinterest
- Child expresses fear, anxiety, or refusal to participate
- Any sign of injury or distress

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

**What to say**:
- "You're doing amazing - you're paddling like a real surfer!"
- "You caught a wave! Feel how the water pushed you?"
- "That was a great fall - you're learning how to wipeout like pros!"
- "Your arms are getting stronger each time"
- "The water is helping you - let it support you"

**What to avoid**:
- Pushing into cold water ("You'll get used to it")
- Forcing participation ("Just try once more")
- Comparing to other children or adult surfers
- Expressing frustration with slow progress
- Minimizing legitimate fears of water and waves

**When to help**:
- Always help child mount and position on board initially
- Support when child is nervous about water depth
- Assist with balance while standing on board
- Help exit water if child is tired
- Provide encouragement when discouraged

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is afraid of water, waves, or the ocean
**Why**: Water is unpredictable; waves are powerful; young children have healthy caution
**Solution**: Start in very calm water or pool setting; build comfort gradually; never force water contact; practice with floaties and flotation devices; celebrate small bravery steps
**Timeline**: Water comfort typically improves over weeks 2-4 of repeated positive exposure

**Challenge**: Child gets very cold and wants to exit after short time
**Why**: Young children have less body fat; water temperature feels colder; tolerance is lower
**Solution**: Check water temperature beforehand (look for warmer season/location); use wetsuits; limit session length; provide warm clothing and drinks; celebrate time in water regardless of duration
**Timeline**: Gradually building endurance; may never like very cold water and that's okay

**Challenge**: Child falls off board frequently and becomes frustrated
**Why**: Balance on unstable surface is genuinely very difficult; falling feels scary
**Solution**: Teach safe falling techniques; normalize falling in water ("That's how you learn"); practice in shallow water; use flotation aids; celebrate attempts; reduce expectations for this age group
**Timeline**: Balance improves with practice; real surfing skill takes years to develop

**Challenge**: Child is reluctant to attempt standing on board
**Why**: Standing on moving board is scary; balance challenge is significant; fear of falling
**Solution**: Practice standing on stationary board on shore first; move to shallow water; offer hand support; never force attempts; celebrate lying down and paddling as real achievement
**Timeline**: Standing skill develops gradually; don't rush this progression

### Progress Tracking
