# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Swimming and Water Activities

## Activity Summary

Swimming and water activities introduce young children to water safety, comfort, and basic movement skills while having tremendous fun. These activities build confidence in aquatic environments, develop gross motor skills like kicking and floating, and strengthen the muscles needed for coordination and balance. Water play is wonderful for sensory development and provides natural resistance training that supports overall physical development.

**Activity Type**: Aquatic Sport

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes (with breaks as needed)

**Energy Level**: Moderate to High

**Best Environment**: Shallow pool (designed for young children), water table, bathtub with supervision, or beach in shallow water

**Space Required**: Shallow water minimum 1-2 feet deep (waist height on adult)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Shallow pool or water table - specifically designed for young children with non-slip surfaces
- Adult supervision (required at all times) - never leave child unattended near water
- Towels - soft, absorbent towels for drying off and warmth
- Swimsuit or water-safe clothing - fitted to prevent chafing, easy to move in
- Water-safe diaper or swim diaper (if needed) - essential for children not yet toilet trained

**Optional enhancements**:
- Flotation aids (arm bands, floaties) - provide confidence without relying solely on them
- Kickboards - help isolate leg movements and build kicking strength
- Water toys (balls, rings, cups) - make water play more engaging and purposeful
- Goggles (age-appropriate) - help children see underwater and reduce water in eyes
- Noodles or tubes - provide buoyancy support and fun movement props
- Stepping stones or pool stairs - make entry and exit safer and more independent
- Washcloths or water mitts - add texture and make splashing more controlled

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use a large plastic tub, kiddie pool, or bathtub for younger toddlers
- Make toys from household items (plastic cups, funnels, sponges)
- Use rolled-up towels as flotation aids
- Create water resistance with empty plastic bottles tied together

**Cost estimate**: Free to $20 (if using pool access you have available); $50-100 if investing in beginner flotation aids and toys

**Safety equipment**:
- Non-slip mat for pool deck or bathtub floor
- CPR certification for supervising adult (highly recommended)
- Life vest or approved flotation device (backup safety measure, not substitute for supervision)
- First aid kit nearby
- Sun protection if outdoors (sunscreen, hat, shade access)

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Check water temperature (85-92°F is ideal for young children; test with your elbow)
2. Inspect water for clarity and safety (remove debris, check chlorine levels if applicable)
3. Prepare shallow entry zone with steps or sloped entry
4. Place non-slip mats around wet areas
5. Arrange toys and equipment within easy reach
6. Set up shaded area for rest breaks
7. Have towels, extra clothing, and dry items ready nearby

**Boundaries**:
- Use physical barriers (pool edge, marked water table perimeter) to define safe play area
- Establish "teacher zone" where children must stay within arm's reach of supervising adult
- Mark depth with visual cues (tape, floor markings) showing where water reaches on children
- Create designated entry/exit points only

**Safety considerations**:
- **Drowning risk**: Never leave child unattended near water for any reason. Drowning is silent and happens in seconds. Maintain constant visual contact and be within arm's reach at all times.
- **Temperature regulation**: Young children lose body heat quickly in water. Limit initial sessions to 10-15 minutes and watch for shivering or bluish lips. Exit immediately if child shows signs of cold.
- **Ear infections**: Prevent water from entering ears by tilting head during water play. If water does enter, have child lie on side to drain. Consider ear plugs or caps for sensitive children.
- **Gag reflex and water aspiration**: Never force child's face into water or expect them to inhale underwater initially. Let them progress naturally and only submerge briefly faces with child's permission and on their terms.
- **Slippery surfaces**: Use non-slip footwear or ensure all wet surfaces have grip. Help child with entry/exit to prevent falls.
- **Sunburn and overheating**: Apply water-resistant sunscreen before entering water. Provide shade and cool water breaks, especially for outdoor water activities.
- **Chemical sensitivity**: If using chlorinated pools, rinse child after sessions and watch for signs of irritation. Some children are sensitive to pool chemicals.
- **Overstimulation**: Cold water, pressure changes, and sensory input can overwhelm young children. Monitor mood and exit if child becomes distressed.

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Help the child adjust to water temperature, transition emotionally to water play, and prepare muscles for activity. Warm-up also gives the child control and builds confidence.

**Warm-up activities**:
1. **Water familiarization** - Sit at pool edge together, dip feet in, splash gently. Talk about how the water feels ("Cool and refreshing!" or "Warm and nice!"). Let child splash freely.
2. **Walk in shallow water** - Walk together slowly in the shallowest part, making footprints and watching water ripple. Move in different directions, stopping to bend down and touch the water.
3. **Gentle bouncing** - Hold child securely and gently bounce in place, creating small splashes. Match it to a rhythmic chant: "Bounce, bounce, bounce in the water, splash, splash, splash!"

**Warm-up cues**:
- "Let's get our bodies ready for water fun!"
- "Splash, splash! The water is saying hello!"
- "We're getting used to how the water feels!"

### Main Activity (10-20 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Start by sitting together at water's edge and point to the water: "This is our special water playground today!"
- Show calm, confident body language to help child feel safe
- Demonstrate simple water movements while child watches from pool edge if needed
- Key coaching point: "Everyone stays right next to me in the water. This water is our special place to play and stay safe."

#### Skill Practice (3-7 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:

1. **Water comfort and floating foundation**
   - Hold child securely while walking slowly through water
   - Encourage child to kick legs while supported
   - Practice lying back gently with full adult support (hand under back and neck)
   - Work on breathing naturally near water without fear

2. **Kicking and leg movements**
   - Demonstrate gentle flutter kicks while holding pool edge (child watches or copies)
   - Support child horizontally and encourage slow, gentle kicks
   - Practice kicking while standing and bouncing
   - Describe kicks as "like a mermaid's tail" or "like a puppy's back legs"

3. **Arm movements and reaching**
   - Practice arm swings moving forward and back
   - Reach for toys while supported, building confidence extending through water
   - Practice pulling water toward face and body (no breath-holding yet)
   - Use scooping motions with hands cupped

**Coaching cues**:
- "Keep your back nice and straight while I hold you."
- "Let your legs do tiny, happy kicks - not big splashes!"
- "Reach for the toy - I've got you safe!"
- "You're doing such a great job staying calm in the water!"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-8 minutes)

**Game structure**: Turn simple movements into playful activities. Keep games short and joyful.

**Games to try**:

1. **Toy Retrieval** - Toss floating toys in very shallow water within arm's reach. Child walks or waddles to retrieve them while supported. Celebrate each find enthusiastically.

2. **Walk the Shallow Path** - Create a simple "path" by walking in a straight line, circle, or zigzag through the shallowest water. Hold child's hand and walk the path together, singing as you go.

3. **Splash and Giggle** - Stand facing child and make small splashes together. Take turns making splashes, keeping it gentle and fun. Watch child's comfort level before increasing intensity.

4. **Float and Sing** - Hold child safely while floating (supported at back and neck) and sing a favorite song slowly. This builds comfort with water, horizontal positioning, and breath awareness.

5. **Ring Around the Rosy** - Adapt the classic game for water: hold hands in very shallow water and circle slowly together. Use water-safe movements instead of traditional actions.

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Everyone stays with the helper in the water - no wandering off alone
2. We use gentle water movements - no jumping or rough splashing
3. We listen for directions to enter, play, and exit safely

**Variations**:
- **For more confidence**: Add deeper exploration gradually, introduce kickboard supported play, try gentle face immersion with permission
- **For less confidence**: Stay in ultra-shallow water, focus on standing activities, use flotation aids for confidence

**Turn-taking** (if multiple children):
- If supervising multiple children, have one child in water with you while others rest, observe, and play with water toys at pool edge
- Rotate every 3-5 minutes
- Use a visual timer so waiting children know when their turn comes

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)
- Allow child to explore water movements naturally
- Provide toys and encourage self-directed play while maintaining supervision
- Observe what water movements and activities interest the child most
- Offer gentle suggestions: "Would you like to walk over here?" or "I see you like splashing - great!"
- Let child lead and follow their comfort and interest

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Transition from active water play to exiting the water calmly. Cool-down also prevents dizziness from sudden activity change and helps regulate body temperature before getting out.

**Cool-down activities**:
1. **Slow walking** - Hold child's hand and walk slowly through the water at a gentle pace, gradually moving toward the exit point
2. **Gentle floating and swaying** - Hold child supported while gently swaying side-to-side, humming or singing a calming song
3. **Water goodbye** - Sit at water's edge and have child wave to the water, saying "Bye water! Thank you for playing!"

**Transition**:
- "It's time to get out of the water now. Our bodies are getting ready to dry off."
- Wrap child in towel immediately upon exit - young children lose body heat rapidly
- Have dry clothes ready to change into right away
- Continue calm, gentle tone to maintain the relaxed mood

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Keep water depth to under 1 foot (ankle to mid-shin on child)
- Focus entirely on comfort and water familiarization, not swimming skills
- Use full physical support (hand under back AND arm support) at all times
- Allow child to wear water-safe diaper or swim pants if needed
- Spend more time on sensory exploration (splashing, pouring, feeling water)
- Use shorter, simpler words and fewer directions
- Expect fear or hesitation - never force entry into water
- Take frequent breaks (5-minute bursts are often enough)
- Have comfort items nearby (favorite water toy, familiar caregiver at edge)

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes total (may include breaks)

**Adult support**: Constant full physical contact and support. This age needs hands-on guidance for every activity.

**Important note**: At this age, swimming lessons are about water safety and comfort only - not actual swimming skills.

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Gradually introduce water games and toys that require more movement
- Practice floating with minimal support (hand just under back, not full body support)
- Begin introducing the concept of "blowing bubbles" without pressure to submerge face
- Increase water depth slightly as comfort grows (to mid-thigh)
- Introduce kickboards with support for more independent kicking practice
- Add simple water rules and expectations ("We stay where the water is safe")
- Practice independent entry and exit with supervision and assistance
- Begin very gentle, optional exploration of eyes/face in water with permission only
- Increase session duration to 15-20 minutes

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes (with better sustained attention)

**Additional skills**:
- Jumping into water from pool edge with adult hands-on support
- Walking deeper into water while holding your hand (within safe depth)
- Rolling from back float to standing position
- Retrieving sinking toys while supported (learning about water physics)

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**:
  - "I can see you're being brave in the water!"
  - "You're learning more about water every time we come!"
  - "I'm right here with you - you're safe."
  - "Look what your legs can do in the water!"
  - "You're doing a great job listening and following directions!"

- **What to avoid**:
  - Never use water as a punishment ("Stop splashing or we're getting out!")
  - Don't compare child to other children ("See how your friend is swimming?")
  - Avoid saying "You're scared" or labeling their emotions negatively
  - Don't force face immersion or jumping - let progression be child-led
  - Never say "It's just water" when child expresses fear - validate their feelings

- **When to help**:
  - Provide full physical support at all times for toddlers (maintain constant contact)
  - Jump in when child shows signs of distress immediately - never wait to see if they "figure it out"
  - Help with entry and exit every single time - don't expect independence here yet
  - Provide verbal guidance and hand signals for movements they're still learning
  - Step back slightly if child shows readiness for slightly more independence, but stay within arm's reach

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child refuses to enter water or becomes very upset at the pool/water

**Why**: Young children have natural caution around unfamiliar environments. Water can feel unsafe because it's unpredictable and child can't see/control what's underneath. Previous negative experience can intensify this fear.

**Solution**:
- Don't force entry - respect the fear as valid
- Sit at pool edge together and just watch the water for several visits
- Let child throw toys in and watch them float/sink
- Get in yourself and stay close, inviting child to join ("I'm in here and it feels nice")
- Start with hand and foot play at the edge
- Gradually work toward sitting on edge with feet in water
- This process may take multiple sessions - that's normal and healthy
- Some children need 3-5 visits just to observe before entering

**Timeline**: Many children overcome water fear by age 3-4 with patient, pressure-free exposure. Some need longer. Forcing speeds up the process dangerously.

---

**Challenge**: Child frequently coughs or gags if any water touches face

**Why**: Young children have sensitive gag reflexes and no experience with water touching their face. The sensation can feel like drowning to them. This is a protective reflex.

**Solution**:
- Keep water below chin until child is much older
- Never splash face or try to get water on the face
- Let child control what happens near their face completely
- If child wants to explore, let them touch water with their own hands first
- Some children benefit from washing face with their own wet washcloth (different sensation)
- Avoid goggles initially - they can increase anxiety
- Focus on other water skills while this develops naturally over time
- By age 4+, you can gently introduce breath awareness ("Let's blow bubbles!") without pressure

**Timeline**: This typically improves between ages 3-5 as children gain more control and familiarity with water. Never rush this.

---

**Challenge**: Child shivers, teeth chatter, or shows signs of being cold

**Why**: Young children's bodies regulate temperature less efficiently than older children. They lose body heat much faster in water, especially if still and not actively moving. Surface area to body mass ratio means they cool rapidly.

**Solution**:
- Keep water temperature warm (85-92°F is ideal)
- Limit initial sessions to 10-15 minutes maximum
- Exit water immediately when you notice first signs of cold
- Have towel ready to wrap child immediately
- Dry child thoroughly and dress in warm clothes right away
- Watch for shivering, pale lips, quiet behavior, or decreased activity
- On cold days or in cooler weather, skip water activities or use warmer water
- Some children are simply more cold-sensitive - honor this and adjust

**Timeline**: As child grows older (4+) and gains body mass, they can stay in water longer. But always err on the side of caution with young toddlers.

---

**Challenge**: Child gets ear infections after water play

**Why**: Water entering the ear canal can introduce bacteria or create moisture that leads to infection. Young children's ears are more prone to this issue.

**Solution**:
- Tilt child's head to side when water play ends (let gravity drain)
- Have child lie on side on towel to help water drain from ear
- Use a clean washcloth to gently pat outer ear dry
- After water play, gently run a dry cotton ball around outer ear (don't insert in canal)
- Consider ear plugs designed for children if infections keep happening
- Some children benefit from a swim cap that covers ears
- If infections are frequent, discuss with pediatrician about water play frequency
- Always dry ears as first step after exiting water

**Timeline**: This usually improves as child gets older and ear canals develop more drainage naturally.

---

**Challenge**: Child won't try floating and panics when in a horizontal position

**Why**: Horizontal position feels vulnerable because child can't see the bottom or see what's in the water. It feels unstable and unsafe.

**Solution**:
- Never force floating - wait until child shows readiness
- Start by having child float on their stomach (face down with goggles, or face to side) with full support
- Use the side-float position first (child on side, looking at you)
- Always maintain full hand support while practicing floating
- Practice on land first - have child lie on a yoga mat or cushion with you holding them
- Use positive reinforcement without pressure
- Some children are naturally more anxious about floating - this improves with age and experience
- Focus on other water skills while floating comfort develops

**Timeline**: Many children don't feel ready for floating until age 4+. This is normal.

### Safety Reminders

- **Constant supervision**: Never leave a child unattended near water. Not for one second. This is non-negotiable. Drowning is silent, instantaneous, and can happen in inches of water.
- **Hand-on contact**: Keep a hand on or touching the child at all times. Use shallow water. Use flotation aids if needed in addition to (not instead of) supervision.
- **Know CPR**: Strongly recommend certification in pediatric CPR before conducting water activities. This is critical emergency knowledge.
- **Temperature check**: Always test water temperature with your elbow before child enters. Water should be warm (85-92°F for young children).
- **No diving or jumping**: Never encourage or allow jumping into water or diving. Young children can't judge water depth and risk serious injury.
- **Exit if distressed**: The moment a child shows real distress (not just normal hesitation), exit the water and take a break. Never push through genuine fear.
- **Screen for health issues**: Ask about ear infections, skin conditions, or sensitivities before water play. Some children need modified water activities.
- **Hydration**: Young children forget to drink while playing. Offer water frequently during and after water play.
- **Sun protection**: Apply water-resistant sunscreen 15 minutes before water play. Reapply frequently. Use rash guards or water shirts if outdoors.

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Willingly enters water with decreasing hesitation
- Tolerates water on body without crying or panicking
- Can bounce in place and move feet in water with support
- Begins attempting kicking motions when supported horizontally
- Shows interest in water toys and retrieval games
- Can walk independently in very shallow water
- Comfortable with splash and water on face (for some children)
- Beginning to make purposeful arm movements in water

**Progression over weeks/months**:
- Week 1-2: Comfort building, water familiarization, sensory exploration
- Week 3-4: Beginning to tolerate more water contact, attempts first movements
- Week 5-8: More confident movements, better kicking, increased play engagement
- 2-3 months: Floating with support, beginning to understand water safety rules
- 3-6 months: More independent movement in very shallow water, reduced anxiety
- 6+ months: Ready to begin more structured water skills (if interest continues)

**When to add challenge**:
- Child enters water independently without hesitation
- Child tolerates 20+ minutes in water comfortably
- Child follows water safety rules without reminders
- Child initiates new movements and skills
- Child expresses interest in "deeper" water or more challenging activities
- Evidence of improved balance and strength in land-based activities too
