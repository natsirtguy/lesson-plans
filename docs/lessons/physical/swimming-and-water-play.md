### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Test water temperature (78-82°F ideal for young children)
2. Check water depth (maximum 18 inches for 2-3 year olds, 2-3 feet for 3-4+ years)
3. Clear water area of hazards (sharp objects, glass, toys with small parts)
4. Set up changing/drying area with towels and spare clothes
5. Apply waterproof sunscreen 15 minutes before entering water
6. Have rescue equipment visible (life ring, rescue hook)

**Boundaries**:
- Use physical barriers (lanes, buoys) to mark safe play area
- Keep children in designated shallow zone only
- Establish clear "exit point" where water play ends
- Keep water entry area free of obstacles

**Safety considerations**:
- **Drowning risk**: Never leave children unattended in or near water. Maintain constant visual supervision within arm's reach
- **Water temperature**: Cold water can cause shock response; acclimatize gradually and monitor for shivering
- **Ear infections**: Ensure water doesn't enter ears; dry ears thoroughly after play
- **Chemical exposure**: Maintain proper pool chlorine levels; rinse off pool water after session
- **Sun exposure**: Reapply waterproof sunscreen every 2 hours; provide shade breaks
- **Fatigue**: Watch for signs of tiredness (slower movements, difficulty focusing) and end session before exhaustion sets in

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Build comfort and confidence in water, gradually acclimate body to water temperature, and prepare muscles for movement

**Warm-up activities**:
1. **Water wading**: Walk slowly in shallow water, feeling the water resistance on legs
2. **Water splashing**: Gently splash water on arms, chest, and face to acclimate to water contact
3. **Marching in place**: March through water, lifting knees high to build leg strength and comfort

**Warm-up cues**:
- "Let's walk like penguins in the water... now like tall giraffes!"
- "Can you make splashes? Gentle splashes like raindrops"
- "March, march, march... lift those knees high!"

### Main Activity (10-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Show child the shallow water and demonstrate how you move in it
- Enter water yourself to model comfort and confidence
- Use simple language: "Watch how I walk in the water... it holds us up!"
- Point out floating toys and water features that make it fun

#### Skill Practice (4-6 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:

**1. Water comfort and entry**:
- Practice sitting on pool edge and splashing
- Hold hands and step down into water slowly
- Walk forward and backward in shallow water
- Lay on back with adult support to feel water buoyancy

**2. Floating and kicking**:
- Practice floating while held securely by adult
- Kick legs gently while floating (life jacket provides security)
- Hold flotation aid and practice independent floating
- Kick while holding pool wall or noodle

**3. Water movement**:
- Practice standing and jumping in shallow water
- Bend knees and push off bottom to create "flying" sensation
- Walk forward reaching arms out like swimming
- Practice simple arm movements alongside wall

**Coaching cues**:
- "Stand tall like a starfish in the water"
- "Make your legs go 'flutter flutter' like a fish tail"
- "Hold onto my hands... I've got you. You're safe"
- "Feel how the water helps you float? You're doing it!"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-7 minutes)

**Game structure**: Turn water skills into playful exploration

**Simple water games**:

**1. Floating Toy Retrieval**:
- Place floating toys in shallow water within reach
- Child walks/wades to collect toys
- Adult holds hand or remains very close
- Child places toys in bucket

**2. Water Ring Toss**:
- Float rings or toys in water
- Child reaches and tries to grab floating items
- Encourages reaching, balance, and water comfort

**3. Follow the Leader**:
- Adult makes simple water movements (walking, splashing, stepping)
- Child imitates movements
- Gradually introduce floating and gentle kicking
- Keep movements fun and non-demanding

**4. Splash and Giggle**:
- Adult gently splashes child with hands (child directs intensity)
- Child splashes back
- Build comfort with water contact through play
- End when child signals they're ready

**Variations**:
- **For younger/less confident**: Stay in shallowest water, use wall for support, increase adult physical support
- **For older/more confident**: Move to slightly deeper water, reduce physical support, introduce mild challenges like reaching toys further away

**Turn-taking** (if with other children):
- Use timer or song to indicate turn length (1-2 minutes each)
- Waiting child gets to be "checker" or "announcer"
- Rotate who goes first each round

#### Free Exploration (1-2 minutes)
- Let child freely explore water movements and toys
- Follow their lead and interest
- Provide encouragement without direction
- Observe what movements bring joy and confidence

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Transition from active water play to calm, prepare body to exit water, wind down before leaving pool area

**Cool-down activities**:
1. **Gentle floating**: Float on back in shallow water while adult supports, focusing on relaxing muscles
2. **Slow water walking**: Walk slowly around shallow area, water up to waist
3. **Water pouring**: Pour calm water over own arms/legs, enjoy sensory experience without high activity
4. **Sitting in water**: Sit in shallow water and watch water movement, creating peaceful transition

**Transition**:
- "Let's make the water movements slower and calmer now"
- Exit water gradually (don't rush the child out)
- Wrap in warm towel immediately to prevent chilling
- Praise their bravery and specific efforts: "You floated all by yourself! You were so brave in the water"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Keep in water less than 18 inches deep
- Maintain constant physical contact (holding adult hands)
- Focus entirely on water comfort, not swimming technique
- Use very short play sessions (10-15 minutes maximum)
- Keep water temperature warm (80-82°F)
- Introduce only basic water play (splashing, wading, floating while held)

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes total session

**Adult support**:
- Hands-on support at all times
- Maintain physical contact during main activity
- Supervise from within arm's reach always
- Expect need for frequent breaks and reassurance

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Gradually reduce physical support (move from hand-holding to finger-tip contact)
- Introduce kickboards and flotation aids with reduced adult contact
- Practice blowing bubbles and face-water comfort
- Add diving tasks (reaching for sunken toys in shallow water)
- Introduce simple "swimming" motions (arm strokes with flotation support)
- Encourage water independence while maintaining supervision

**Duration**: Can extend to 20-25 minutes

**Physical progression**:
- Independent floating with flotation aid
- Coordinated kicking with proper flotation
- Front crawl arm motions with support
- Increased water confidence and reduced fear responses

## Extension Ideas

### Session Extensions
- **Water song time**: Sing water safety songs ("Splashing, splashing, staying close," tune of "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
- **Sensory exploration**: Fill water table with floating items; let child explore different flotation styles
- **Water color play**: Add food coloring to clear water (non-chlorinated) to explore color mixing
- **Ice floating**: Float ice cubes and explore melting (supervision essential)

### Learning Connections
- **Floating science**: Discuss why some toys float and others sink
- **Body awareness**: Name body parts as water touches them: "Water on your toes! Water on your arms!"
- **Rhythm and movement**: Move to water-themed music while in water

### Home Practice
- Bath time floating practice (with proper support and safety precautions)
- Bucket and sponge water play outside
- Shower water play (adjustable stream to build comfort)
- Picture books about water and swimming

### Progression Framework
- **Week 1-2**: Water comfort and basic wading
- **Week 3-4**: Floating with support and guided exploration
- **Week 5-6**: Increased independence and skill practice
- **Week 7-8**: Combining skills and play-based application

## Safety and Supervision

### Drowning Prevention

**Critical rules**:
- Constant visual supervision from within arm's reach (no exceptions)
- Never leave child unattended near water, even for seconds
- Another trained adult should supervise (never one adult alone with multiple children)
- Children must wear properly fitted USCG-approved life jackets
- No flotation devices substitute for adult supervision and life jackets

**Signs of distress** (not always obvious):
- Inability to call for help or quiet struggling
- Tilted head, mouth at water level
- Glazed eyes or inability to focus
- Gasping for air or difficulty breathing
- Vertical position in water with minimal movement

### Water Quality & Health

**Pool/water safety**:
- Verify proper chlorine levels (1.0-3.0 ppm for pools)
- Ensure water temperature is appropriate (78-82°F for young children)
- Check for visible contamination or algae
- Ensure proper filtration system is functioning
- Natural water areas: check for currents, depth changes, and hazards

**Health precautions**:
- Apply waterproof sunscreen (SPF 30+) 15 minutes before water exposure
- Reapply every 2 hours and after toweling off
- Use rash guard or UV-protective clothing for extended sun exposure
- Ensure child uses restroom before water play
- Rinse off pool chemicals after session
- Dry ears thoroughly to prevent infection (can use cotton balls gently)
- Monitor for signs of aquatic illness (diarrhea, rashes)

### Emergency Preparedness

**Before session**:
- Know location of lifeguard or staff
- Know location of first aid kit and rescue equipment
- Have phone accessible for emergency calls
- Know CPR techniques (recommended certification)
- Identify nearest hospital or medical facility
- Have emergency contact information readily available

**During session**:
- Never turn your back on children in or near water
- Count children regularly (if supervising multiple)
- Avoid distractions (phone, conversations) during supervision
- Keep rescue equipment within immediate reach
- Know how to perform basic rescue techniques

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

**What to say**:
- "You're doing an amazing job! Look how you're floating"
- "It's okay to feel scared. I'm right here with you"
- "Every time we come, you get braver. I can see it"
- "Feel the water holding you up? That's buoyancy helping"
- Specific praise: "You kicked your legs so hard! Strong legs!"

**What to avoid**:
- "Don't be scared" (validates fear without addressing it)
- Throwing children in water or forcing them under
- Making fun of fear or hesitation
- Comparing child to other swimmers
- Rushing progression; let child set pace
- Using water as punishment or threat

**When to help**:
- Provide hands-on support until child initiates independence
- Help when child shows fear or distress
- Gently encourage trying new skills but accept "not today"
- Support until child has succeeded once, then reduce support gradually
- Always maintain within-arm's-reach supervision

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is afraid of water or resistant to entering

**Why**: Water is unfamiliar sensory experience; young children need time to acclimate to new environments; previous negative experiences (splashing in face, water up nose) can create fear

**Solution**:
- Let child control pace completely; never force entry
- Start with just feet in water or playing with water in bucket
- Allow observation from safety before participation
- Play water games on pool deck first (splash with hands, wet toys)
- Gradually increase contact over multiple sessions
- Use positive peer modeling if other children are comfortable
- Consider individual sessions if child is significantly behind peers

**Timeline**: May take 4-8 sessions; some children need weeks or months

---

**Challenge**: Child panics or cries during water session

**Why**: Overstimulation from temperature, noise, splashing, or loss of control; unexpected water in face or ears can trigger panic; separation anxiety

**Solution**:
- Exit water immediately; don't force child to stay in
- Provide comfort and reassurance; validate feelings
- Wrap in warm towel and calm environment
- Don't punish fear response; treat as normal developmental step
- Next session, start with even shorter time or shallower water
- Consider private lesson with calm instructor
- Ensure child is warm and dry before attempting again

**Timeline**: May need to restart progression; patience essential for long-term water comfort

---

**Challenge**: Difficulty floating independently or coordinating movements

**Why**: Core muscle development still developing; balance and proprioception developing; fear of losing bottom support creates tension that prevents floating; coordination skills still maturing

**Solution**:
- Continue flotation aid use without pressure to progress
- Practice in very shallow water where child can stand anytime
- Use kickboard to isolate kick practice
- Try prone (face-down) position before supine (face-up) floating
- Build arm and core strength through water games
- Don't compare to other children; all develop at own pace
- Consider professional swim instruction if available

**Timeline**: Independent floating typically develops 3-4+ years; earlier attempts with support are fine

---

**Challenge**: Child gets tired quickly or loses interest

**Why**: Physical exertion is significant in water environment; attention spans for young children short; water temperature can increase fatigue; overstimulation from sensory input

**Solution**:
- Keep initial sessions very short (10 minutes)
- Build duration gradually as fitness improves
- Offer variety: water games, free play, toy exploration
- Alternate active play with rest periods
- Check water temperature isn't too warm
- Ensure child is well-rested before session
- Snack and hydration before water time
- End on positive note; don't push through fatigue

**Timeline**: Stamina improves with repeated exposure over weeks

### Safety Reminders

- **Supervision is non-negotiable**: Never leave children unattended in or near water. Drowning can happen silently and quickly
- **Life jacket requirement**: Properly fitted USCG-approved life jacket required at all times in water
- **One adult per child minimum**: For this age group, recommend one adult actively supervising each child
- **Sun protection**: Reapply waterproof sunscreen frequently; limit sun exposure especially midday
- **Temperature monitoring**: Watch for shivering or blue lips; exit water if child gets too cold
- **Ear care**: Dry ears promptly after water play to prevent infections
- **Hydration**: Provide frequent water breaks even though in water (dehydration can occur)
- **Bathroom needs**: Ensure frequent bathroom breaks; watch for accidents in water

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Decreased anxiety entering water
- Willingness to play independently with flotation
- Attempt to float with minimal adult support
- Coordinated kicking motions
- Ability to blow bubbles or put face in water
- Longer session duration without fatigue
- Expression of fun or enjoyment during water play
- Anticipatory excitement before water sessions

**When to add challenge**:
- Child initiates more independent floating
- Shows comfort in water and reduced fear
- Consistently demonstrates skills from earlier stages
- Expresses desire to do "harder" activities
- Can follow simple water safety instructions
