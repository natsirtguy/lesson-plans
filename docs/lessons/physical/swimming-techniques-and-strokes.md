# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Swimming Techniques and Strokes

## Activity Summary

Swimming techniques and strokes introduce young children to water movement, breath control, and aquatic propulsion. This activity builds water confidence, lung capacity, and coordination while developing essential survival skills. Swimming strengthens the entire body, improves cardiovascular fitness, and creates joy in aquatic environments.

**Activity Type**: Aquatic sport

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes (including entry, warm-up, and rest breaks)

**Energy Level**: High

**Best Environment**: Swimming pool, calm lake, or controlled water area with appropriate depth

**Space Required**: Shallow water area (waist-deep for caregiver minimum); 30+ feet of clear water space

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- U.S. Coast Guard-approved personal flotation device (PFD) or life jacket - properly fitted to child's weight
- Swim diapers or waterproof training pants (if child is not toilet trained)
- Non-slip water shoes or footwear
- Towel and dry clothes (including underwear and shirt)
- Waterproof bag for belongings

**Optional enhancements**:
- Floating kickboard for leg-focused practice
- Pull buoy (foam device for arm-focused practice)
- Kickboard with handles for comfort
- Fins/flippers (sized for children) to assist leg motion
- Goggles (if child is comfortable; optional for 2-4 year olds)
- Snorkel (not recommended for children under 4; supervision critical)
- Colored dive rings or sinking toys for water exploration
- Noodle or flotation aid for balance support
- Waterproof tablet/speaker for music to make strokes rhythmic

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use household items as flotation (empty water bottles, foam, well-supervised)
- Create targets using cones or bucket markers in shallow water
- Make simple kickboards from foam or cork
- Use natural water features (rocks, shallow areas) for exploration

**Cost estimate**: $20-50 (life jacket, swim attire); pool entry $5-15/visit; optional equipment adds $15-50

**Safety equipment**:
- Coast Guard-approved life jacket (non-negotiable until independent swimmer)
- First aid kit at pool/water's edge
- Rescue buoy and rope within immediate reach
- CPR-trained adult present
- Whistle for emergency signals
- Shade/shelter from sun
- Sunscreen and sun-protective clothing
- Temperature-appropriate clothing (rash guard for sun protection)

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Scout water entry point: gentle slope, non-slip surface, easy access/egress
2. Verify water depth: entry area should be waist-deep for caregiver (at least 2-3 feet)
3. Ensure water is clear, clean, and free of hazards (sharp objects, debris, strong currents)
4. Check temperature: warmer water (75-82°F) optimal for young children; avoid cold water below 65°F
5. Scout shaded area for rest breaks and hydration
6. Identify safety barriers (pool edge for pools, shore markers for natural water)
7. Have backup caregiver positioned for safety monitoring if possible
8. Check for proper drain covers and no entrapment hazards (critical in pools)

**Boundaries**:
- Define shallow water zone (waist-deep for adult) as play area
- Mark boundaries with flotation lines, ropes, or natural landmarks
- Establish no-go zones (deeper water, diving areas, other zones)
- Keep child within immediate arm's reach or clear line of sight at all times

**Safety considerations**:
- Never leave child unattended in or near water; constant supervision mandatory
- Ensure all children wearing properly fitted, Coast Guard-approved life jackets
- Check water temperature; avoid cold water without wetsuit
- Watch for signs of water fatigue or distress (labored breathing, disorientation, quietness)
- Establish clear "stop" signals and teach child to use them
- Ensure rescue equipment accessible and adults trained in water rescue
- Monitor for hyperthermia (overheating) and hypothermia (excessive cold)
- Never pressure child into water if fearful; build confidence at child's pace
- Avoid water with currents, waves, or motorized traffic
- Create clear protocol for entering water (gradual vs. jumping in)
- Teach child to call for help if separated or in difficulty
- Provide frequent rest breaks and hydration (children dehydrate in water)

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually acclimate to water temperature; prepare muscles; build confidence

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Wade into water gradually: "Step, step, step. The water is nice. Can you feel it?"
2. Splash water on arms and torso: "Make the water warmer by splashing; wet your shoulders"
3. Gentle movement in shallow water: walk, march, sway - "Let's dance in the water"
4. Blow bubbles and feel water on face: "Make bubbles like a fish; blow out slowly"

**Warm-up cues**: "We're getting our bodies ready to learn to swim like fish and dolphins!"

### Main Activity (12-20 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- Show floating/buoyancy concept: "Your body floats in water like a boat. The water helps hold you up."
- Demonstrate basic kick: "Legs move up and down, back and forth; they help push you through the water"
- Show arm motion: "Arms reach forward and pull the water back; that helps you go forward"
- Explain breath control: "We blow out in water, breathe in when face is up; like blowing bubbles"

#### Skill Practice (4-8 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
- **Floating and buoyancy**: Vertical and horizontal floating; feeling water support
- **Leg kick**: Continuous, rhythmic leg movement (flutter kick, whip kick)
- **Arm strokes**: Forward reach and pull motion (basic paddle, freestyle-like motion)
- **Breath control**: Blowing bubbles, inhaling on turnings or sides
- **Coordination**: Combining kicks and arm strokes with rhythm

**Coaching cues**:
- "Feel the water holding you up; relax and trust it"
- "Kick from your hips, not your knees; make big waves"
- "Pull the water backward with your hands; reach forward and pull"
- "Blow bubbles in the water; that's how you breathe underwater"
- "One arm pulls while the other reaches; they take turns"
- "You're swimming! Keep moving!"

#### Guided Play/Game (6-10 minutes)

**Game structure**: Transform stroke practice into water play and exploration

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Stay in the shallow water zone
2. Wear your life jacket the whole time
3. Tell an adult when you need a break

**Variations**:
- **Bubble competition**: Who can make the most bubbles? Biggest bubbles? Longest bubbles?
- **Kick races**: Kickboard races or kicking to targets at various distances
- **Follow the leader**: Child follows caregiver's swimming path and mimics strokes
- **Water walking**: Walk in the water in different directions; backward walking is funny
- **Reach and touch**: Reach out and touch floating toys or marked spots in water
- **Stroke counts**: "Swim five arm strokes, then rest"; gradually increase
- **Floating adventures**: Practice floating on back or front; add gentle propulsion
- **Dive ring chase**: Toss rings or toys for child to retrieve from shallow bottom
- **Water songs**: Teach songs about swimming; move with the rhythm

**Turn-taking** (if applicable):
- If using flotation equipment, take turns with kickboard
- Child and caregiver alternate demonstrating strokes
- Multiple children can race or play alongside each other with supervision

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

Let child experiment with different strokes, speeds, and water movements without formal instruction.
- What to encourage: Trying different kicks, making larger/smaller movements, exploring buoyancy
- When to observe: Watch for signs of fatigue, cold, or discomfort; offer rest breaks

### Cool-Down (3-5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Safely transition from active swimming; prevent rapid cooling; celebrate accomplishments

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow walking in shallow water: "Let's take a nice, slow stroll through the water"
2. Gentle floating and resting: "Float and feel the water supporting you"
3. Wade toward shore: "Time to head back; the water helped us have so much fun today"

**Transition**: "You swam like a fish! Let's get dried off and rest."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Focus on water comfort and play rather than formal stroke technique
- Use flotation aids liberally (life jacket, noodle, kickboard)
- Keep water entry very shallow (ankle to shin depth for starting)
- Emphasize sensory exploration: splashing, pouring, blowing bubbles
- Adult provides constant physical contact and support
- Very short sessions: 10-15 minutes maximum active water time
- Emphasis on joy and comfort in water rather than performance

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes of water time

**Adult support**:
- Provide hands-on support for flotation and movement
- Hold child while demonstrating floating
- Guide leg kicks with physical support
- Stand in water with child; never leave unattended
- Manage entry and exit; child may need significant help
- Make water experience playful and non-pressured

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Practice floating independently for brief periods (5-10 seconds)
- Develop rhythmic kicking with bent knees and hip extension
- Practice arm strokes with developing power and reach
- Introduce flutter kick alternation (one leg, then the other)
- Practice breath control: breathing from different sides, breath timing
- Attempt basic dog-paddle or beginner freestyle motion
- Navigate from one point to another using combined strokes
- Practice treading water or vertical floating
- Develop comfort with water in face (goggles optional)

**Duration**: Can extend to 20-30 minutes with frequent rest breaks

**Additional skills**:
- More independent floating with minimal support
- Coordinated kick and arm strokes in sequence
- Awareness of body position in water
- Increasing water confidence and reduced anxiety
- Ability to retrieve objects from shallow bottom
- Understanding of water depth and personal swimming level

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**:
  - "You're floating so well! The water is helping you"
  - "Your kicks are making great waves!"
  - "Your arms are pulling the water so powerfully!"
  - "You're becoming a better swimmer every day"
  - "Everyone learns to swim at their own pace; you're doing great"
  - "I'm so proud of how brave you are in the water!"

- **What to avoid**:
  - Don't push or pressure child into water activities; go at their pace
  - Don't compare to other swimmers or siblings ("She can float better")
  - Don't express anxiety about water ("Be careful! It's deep!")
  - Don't use water as punishment or threat ("If you're bad, no swimming")
  - Don't dive suddenly under water if child has water aversion

- **When to help**:
  - Provide physical support during floating practice
  - Guide arm strokes gently; correct technique through demonstration
  - Offer steady hand contact if child feels anxious
  - Intervene if child shows fatigue, distress, or discomfort
  - Use positive verbal cuing rather than criticism

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is terrified of water or refuses to enter water
**Why**: Fear can stem from previous frightening experience, cold water shock, or personality predisposition toward caution
**Solution**: Go extremely slowly; start with ankle-deep water; pour water gently on body; let child pour water on themselves; practice on land first; never force; celebrate small brave steps; consider pool warmer than natural water
**Timeline**: Water comfort builds over weeks and months of positive, pressure-free exposure

**Challenge**: Child inhales water and panics or coughs
**Why**: Water in nose or mouth triggers gag reflex; child loses composure; fear escalates
**Solution**: Practice blowing bubbles and breathing control on land and in extremely shallow water first; use gentle "face splashing" desensitization; teach "nose blowing" and controlled breathing; stay calm so child doesn't panic; never force head underwater
**Timeline**: Breath control develops gradually; takes several weeks of practice

**Challenge**: Child won't move legs to kick or keeps legs stiff
**Why**: Fear, lack of awareness of how to move legs, tension from anxiety
**Solution**: Start on land demonstrating kick; use flotation support so child feels secure; hold child and move legs for them; use visual cues ("kick like a frog"); make it playful
**Timeline**: Natural kicking develops around age 3-4; some children need more practice

**Challenge**: Child gets very cold quickly and shivers or becomes uncomfortable
**Why**: Young children lose body heat faster than adults; water temperature is cool or child is thin
**Solution**: Use warmer water (heated pools are ideal); limit cold water exposure; use rash guard or light wetsuit; take frequent warm-up breaks; watch for shivering and end session; choose warmer season if using natural water
**Timeline**: Cold tolerance improves with age; always prioritize child's comfort

### Safety Reminders

- Constant supervision is mandatory; never leave child unattended in or near water, even for moments
- Life jacket must be worn until child is a confident, independent swimmer
- Know CPR and have trained rescue personnel present
- Establish clear hand signals for "help me" and "stop" before water activities
- Check water conditions, temperature, and safety before each session
- Prevent water intoxication: limit water intake; take breaks; watch for lethargy
- Avoid diving, jumping in headfirst, or other risky behaviors for young children
- End session immediately if child shows distress, overheating, excessive cold, or exhaustion
- Never leave child in flotation device unattended (increased drowning risk)
- Ensure proper drain cover safety in pools (entrapment risk)

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Enters water calmly and stays in water for extended periods
- Demonstrates floating with buoyancy support and decreasing anxiety
- Performs kicking motions with developing rhythm and power
- Makes arm stroking motions coordinated with kicks
- Shows ability to blow bubbles and recover breath
- Navigates from point to point in shallow water with developing confidence
