# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Tennis and Racquet Activities

## Activity Summary

Tennis and racquet activities introduce young children to hand-eye coordination, balance, and the fundamental skill of using a handheld implement to strike a ball. Through simplified racquet play, children develop shoulder strength, wrist control, and spatial awareness while learning to track moving objects and anticipate ball trajectory. This activity builds confidence in handling equipment and establishes foundational skills for future racquet sports in a playful, low-pressure environment.

**Activity Type**: Sport-based

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Moderate to High

**Best Environment**: Indoor gymnasium or outdoor hard surface (court, driveway)

**Space Required**: 15x20 feet minimum

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Oversized foam tennis racquet or junior racquet (light weight, 14-17 inches long)
- Soft foam ball or whiffle ball (2-3 inches diameter, very light)
- Low net or rope strung between cones (optional, but helpful)
- Court or marked play area

**Optional enhancements**:
- Multiple racquets (different sizes for different hands)
- Variety of soft balls (different textures and weights)
- Cones to mark zones or boundaries
- Foam padding on court edges
- Oversized target zone or goal area
- Ball launcher or thrower to feed balls gently

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use children's plastic bat instead of racquet
- Create paddle from foam board with handle wrapped in tape
- Use balloon as ball (floats slowly, easier to track)
- Roll newspaper tightly and tape to create paddle
- Use sock ball or yarn ball instead of tennis ball
- Mark court with chalk on driveway or pavement

**Cost estimate**: Free (household items) to under $30

**Safety equipment**: Protective eyewear is optional but recommended; cushioned court surface recommended

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Mark court boundaries with cones, tape, or chalk
2. Create low net (if available) strung between stands at knee-height
3. Clear area of obstacles, furniture, and hard edges
4. Ensure soft playing surface or padding on court edges
5. Position so children can safely retrieve balls without running into walls

**Boundaries**: Use cones or chalk to mark:
- Court boundaries (rectangular play area)
- Service zones (where children stand to hit)
- Target zones (if using goal-based variations)

**Safety considerations**:
- Use only soft foam balls (no hard tennis balls)
- Ensure racquet grip is appropriate for small hands
- Keep area clear of hard edges or obstacles
- Establish rule: "No swinging racquet when others are nearby"
- Monitor for over-swinging that could cause loss of balance
- Ensure adequate space for follow-through

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare shoulders, wrists, and core for racquet swinging; increase heart rate and focus

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Wrist circles - rotate wrists in small circles 5 times each direction
2. Shoulder rolls - roll shoulders backward 5 times, then forward 5 times
3. Side-to-side stepping - step side to side while reaching arms across body

**Warm-up cues**: "Let's get our wrists and shoulders loose for hitting!" / "Make tiny circles with your wrists!" / "Feel your body getting warm and ready!"

### Main Activity (8-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Show how to hold racquet (grip with both hands, relaxed)
- Demonstrate basic ready position (feet apart, knees slightly bent, racquet held at chest)
- Show simple swing motion: from ready position, swing racquet forward to contact ball, follow through
- Key coaching point: "We're going to hit the ball with our racquet using a nice, easy swing!"

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
1. **Holding the racquet** - Grip with both hands, hold handle firmly but not tight, racquet at chest level
2. **Ready position** - Stand with feet apart, knees slightly bent, weight balanced
3. **Swing motion** - From ready position, swing racquet forward to meet ball, follow through across body

**Coaching cues**:
- "Hold the racquet like you're holding a hug!"
- "Stand like you're ready to jump - feet apart, knees a little bent"
- "Swing the racquet like you're waving a big magic wand"
- "Watch the ball all the way to your racquet"
- "Keep your follow-through smooth - let the racquet keep moving after you hit"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-8 minutes)

**Game structure**: "Hit and Chase" (for younger) or "Rally Time" (for older)

**Simple version (ages 2-3)**:
- Adult holds ball at child's racquet level and releases it gently
- Child swings and tries to hit ball
- Adult celebrates any contact with racquet
- Adult retrieves ball
- Repeat - focus on swing motion, not hitting successfully
- Use very light ball (foam) that moves slowly

**Advanced version (ages 3-4+)**:
- Adult feeds ball gently (underhand) toward child
- Child swings and tries to hit ball toward target area
- Ball bounces to adult who returns it
- Start building simple rally (adult hits ball back, child hits again)
- Use two racquets for back-and-forth hitting
- Gradually increase ball speed and rally length

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Hold racquet with both hands
2. Swing when ball comes toward you
3. Hit gently and control your swing
4. Only swing when ready (no wild swinging)

**Variations**:
- **Wall hitting**: Hit ball against wall and retrieve bouncing ball
- **Target zones**: Mark zones on ground - hit ball to land in zones
- **Over the net**: Simple net setup at knee height - hit ball over net
- **Balloon batting**: Use balloon instead of ball (floats slowly, easier to track)
- **Partner rally**: With adult or older sibling, try to keep ball in rally going back and forth

**Turn-taking** (if applicable): If multiple children, rotate through: hitter, retriever, cheerleader roles. Keep rotations frequent and simple.

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)
- Let children experiment with different swing styles
- Encourage exploration of how hard/soft to swing
- Allow practice hitting stationary ball if needed

**What to encourage**:
- "Try different ways of swinging!"
- "Watch what happens when you swing different speeds!"
- "You're learning how your racquet moves!"

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Lower heart rate, reduce excitement, celebrate effort and fun

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow walking around court with racquet held low
2. Gentle wrist stretches - extend arm and gently pull fingers back with other hand
3. Seated rest with water - sit and recover while discussing activity

**Transition**: "Great hitting! You worked those arms hard. Now let's slow down and rest..."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Use very oversized, light racquet designed for toddlers
- Use balloon as ball (very slow, easy to track)
- Adult should feed ball directly to child (not serve)
- Release ball gently so it comes slowly toward child
- Accept any swing motion as success (form not important)
- Shorter play sessions (child gets tired quickly)
- Lower net or no net - focus on hitting motion
- Celebrate racquet contact with ball, regardless of result

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes total

**Adult support**: Very hands-on - feed ball gently repeatedly, guide swing motion if needed, celebrate enthusiastically, retrieve all balls

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Use standard junior racquet (18-19 inches)
- Use foam tennis ball or soft ball (not balloon)
- Introduce basic court boundaries
- Add low net (knee-height) to hit over
- Teach ready position and simple footwork
- Introduce concept of rally (keeping ball in play for 2-3 hits)
- Add directional hitting ("Hit to the right side")
- Increase ball speed and consistency of feeding

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Additional skills**:
- More consistent ball contact
- Better racquet control
- Basic footwork adjustment
- Understanding of court positioning

## Extension Ideas

**At home**:
- Practice hitting against wall indoors (soft ball only)
- Hit balloon in living room (very safe, easy to track)
- Create targets on wall with tape - try to hit targets
- Practice ready position and swing motion without ball
- Hit ball into net or goal area in hallway or garage
- Practice with older sibling or adult partner

**Make it harder**:
- Increase height of net progressively
- Increase distance from net
- Decrease ball size slightly
- Increase ball speed as fed by adult
- Practice hitting from different court positions
- Try to keep rally going longer (3+ hits back and forth)
- Add targets or zones to hit toward

**Make it easier**:
- Use balloon instead of ball
- Use oversized racquet designed for toddlers
- Adult places ball stationary; child hits without movement
- Adult hand-feeds ball very slowly
- Focus only on swing motion, no net or targets
- Use very short court distances
- Let child stand still and swing (no footwork)

## Safety and Supervision

### Constant Supervision
- Stay within visual range and ready to intervene at all times
- Pay close attention during all swinging
- Watch for unsafe swinging near other children
- Monitor for balance loss or falling
- Stay alert for ball coming off racquet in unexpected direction

### Equipment Safety
- Use only oversized, lightweight racquets for small hands
- Ensure racquet grip is appropriate and not slippery
- Check racquet regularly for cracks or damage
- Use only soft foam balls or balloons (never hard balls)
- Inspect ball condition before each session

### Swinging Safety
- Establish clear rule: "Only swing when you have space around you"
- Keep other children at safe distance during swinging
- Monitor for wild, uncontrolled swings
- Prevent swinging indoors near light fixtures or breakables
- Teach safe racquet handling (hold at side, not raised, when not swinging)

### Court Safety
- Keep court free of obstacles and hard edges
- Use padding on court edges if available
- Ensure non-slip surface (especially indoors)
- Keep court area clear of spectators during active play
- Prevent running into walls or obstacles while chasing ball

### When to Take a Break
- If child seems fatigued or losing balance
- If swing becomes unsafe or uncontrolled
- If focus is clearly lost
- Every 5-7 minutes for 2-3 year olds
- After any near-miss or unsafe moment (reset focus)
- If child shows frustration with missing hits

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

**What to say**:
- "I love your swing - it's smooth and strong!"
- "You hit that ball! Great racquet control!"
- "You're getting better at watching the ball!"
- "Everyone hits differently - your way is perfect!"
- "That took strength and coordination - wonderful!"

**What to avoid**:
- Correcting swing every time (let them develop naturally)
- Focusing only on successful hits
- Comparing abilities with other children
- Using "perfect" or "best" language
- Expressing frustration with misses
- Expecting adult-like tennis form from young children

**When to help**:
- Guide racquet through swing motion gently (if really struggling)
- Hand-feed ball slowly directly to their racquet
- Demonstrate the motion while they watch
- Reposition yourself to feed from easier angle
- Celebrate effort and motion, not just results
- Help them stand in better ready position

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child can't make contact with ball; keeps missing swings

**Why**: Tracking moving object and timing swing is complex coordination skill

**Solution**: Use balloon instead of ball (much slower). Have adult place ball stationary and child swings at it. Start with ball at very close range. Use oversized racquet with large hitting surface. Feed ball from multiple angles until child finds timing.

**Timeline**: Consistent contact usually develops by age 3.5-4 with regular practice

---

**Challenge**: Child swings too hard, loses balance, or swings dangerously near others

**Why**: Young children don't regulate force well; excitement can lead to unsafe behavior

**Solution**: Practice ready position and basic swing without ball first. Use word cue "gentle swing" or "easy swing." Start with balloon (forces gentle motion). Stop activity if unsafe behavior continues; reset expectations.

**Timeline**: Better control develops as strength and coordination improve; weekly practice helps

---

**Challenge**: Child gets frustrated with missing and doesn't want to continue

**Why**: Missing feels like failure; young children need more success to maintain motivation

**Solution**: Dramatically increase ease of task - use stationary ball, oversized racquet, larger ball. Make every swing a "win" by adjusting difficulty. Use balloon instead. Take break and try different variation. Focus on fun of swinging, not results.

**Timeline**: Frustration tolerance increases with age; ensuring success keeps them engaged

---

**Challenge**: Child is afraid of ball coming toward them

**Why**: Ball coming toward face feels threatening; fear is natural response

**Solution**: Use balloon instead (feels less threatening). Start much farther away from net. Have adult feed ball very slowly. Let them watch you hit for several minutes first. Build confidence gradually with positive experiences.

**Timeline**: Fear typically decreases within 2-3 sessions with safe experiences

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Makes consistent contact between racquet and ball
- Maintains grip throughout swing
- Shows basic ready position
- Demonstrates follow-through motion
- Tracks ball visually before contact
- Shows balance during and after swing
- Expresses enthusiasm to continue playing

**Progression over weeks/months**:
- Week 1-2: Minimal contact with ball, excitement about swinging
- Week 3-4: Regular contact with ball, basic swing form
- Week 5-8: Improved consistency, better ready position
- Month 3+: Can keep simple rally going, shows court awareness

**When to add challenge**: When child makes contact 7+ times in 10 attempts and shows sustained focus without frustration
