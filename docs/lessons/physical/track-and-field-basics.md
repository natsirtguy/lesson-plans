# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Track and Field Basics

## Activity Summary

Track and field basics introduce young children to simple running, jumping, and throwing movements in a structured but playful format. These foundational athletic skills build leg strength, coordination, balance, and spatial awareness while encouraging healthy competition and personal achievement. Track and field activities help children develop body awareness and set the stage for organized sports participation.

**Activity Type**: Sport-based motor skill development

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: High

**Best Environment**: Outdoor open space or indoor gymnasium

**Space Required**: Large open area (30x30 feet ideal)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Soft foam balls or tennis balls (4-6 balls, various sizes)
- Cones or markers (8-10, to mark lanes and boundaries)
- Painter's tape or chalk (to create simple lines on ground)
- Small hurdles or low barriers (12-18 inches high)
- Jump rope or hula hoops (for starting line and jumping areas)

**Optional enhancements**:
- Stopwatch or timer (makes racing more fun)
- Simple obstacle course elements (low tunnels, stepping stones)
- Colored bibs or wristbands (if multiple children)
- Finish line ribbon or tape (makes accomplishment visual)

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use rolled towels, pool noodles, or household items as hurdles
- Create lines with rope or string instead of tape
- Use paper bowls as cones
- Homemade beanbags from socks filled with rice or beans

**Cost estimate**: Under $20 (mostly reusable items)

**Safety equipment**:
- Proper athletic shoes with grip
- First aid kit nearby

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear the space of obstacles, furniture, and hazards
2. Mark out a large rectangular field with boundaries using cones or tape
3. Create several lanes (parallel lines 6-8 feet apart) for running activities
4. Set up distinct zones: sprinting area, jumping area, throwing area
5. Ensure good visibility and no glare issues

**Boundaries**: Use cones at corners and center lines with tape to define specific zones. Children understand they stay within marked areas.

**Safety considerations**:
- Ensure flat, even running surface free of holes or uneven ground
- Maintain adequate spacing between children to prevent collisions (minimum 10 feet between active participants)
- Clear throwing zones of other children and spectators
- Keep water and rest areas just outside the field
- Weather check: avoid extreme heat, cold, or wet conditions

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (3-4 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually elevate heart rate, warm muscles, increase body awareness, and transition from calm to active play

**Warm-up activities**:
1. **Gentle jogging in place** - Start with marching, then light jogging. "Let's wake up our legs and get ready to run!"
2. **Arm circles and swings** - Swing arms in circles (forward and backward). "Make big windmills with your arms!"
3. **High-knee marching** - March while lifting knees toward chest. "Lift your knees up high like you're stepping over puddles!"
4. **Leg swings** - Hold onto an adult or wall and swing legs gently forward and back. "Swing your leg like a pendulum!"

**Warm-up cues**: "Let's get our bodies ready to be athletes! Shake out your arms and legs. Feel the energy building!"

### Main Activity (12-18 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- Gather children and explain: "Today we're track and field athletes! We'll practice running fast, jumping far, and throwing accurately."
- Demonstrate correct sprinting posture: upright torso, pumping arms, focused forward
- Show proper throwing stance and gentle jumping technique
- Key coaching point: "It's not about being the fastest—it's about trying your best!"

#### Skill Practice (4-6 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:

1. **Sprinting basics**
   - Stand tall with feet shoulder-width apart
   - Lean slightly forward
   - Pump arms vigorously, elbows at 90 degrees
   - Land on midfoot, not heel
   - Look ahead, not down

2. **Jumping distance**
   - Stand with feet together or slightly apart
   - Swing arms backward, bend knees
   - Explode upward with arm swing forward
   - Land on both feet together
   - Step out of landing area

3. **Throwing accuracy**
   - Hold ball at chest level
   - Step forward with opposite foot
   - Rotate shoulder and extend arm
   - Release with follow-through
   - Walk back to starting position (teach safety)

**Coaching cues**:
- "Stand tall like a strong runner with your chest out!"
- "Pump those arms like you're climbing invisible ropes!"
- "Push off the ground hard with your legs to jump high!"
- "Keep your eyes on your target when you throw!"
- "Nice effort! You're getting stronger!"

#### Guided Play/Game (5-8 minutes)

**Game structure**: Organize simple track and field stations where children rotate through different activities.

**Station rotations** (2 minutes each):

1. **Sprint Zone**
   - Mark a 20-30 foot sprinting lane
   - Children sprint from start to finish line
   - Adult times or counts steps
   - Walk back to start
   - Repeat 2-3 times

2. **Jump Zone**
   - Mark a line on the ground
   - Children stand and perform standing long jumps
   - Mark where they land
   - Measure or compare distances (non-competitive)
   - 5-6 attempts per child

3. **Throw Zone**
   - Place targets (hula hoops, marked circles) at various distances
   - Children throw soft foam balls at targets
   - Collect and repeat
   - 5-6 throws per child

**Variations**:
- Create relay races where children sprint together as a team
- Add obstacles like low hurdles or step-overs in sprinting lanes
- Create a "standing long jump challenge" with tape markers
- Use beanbags instead of balls for throwing (slower, more control)
- Create target zones of different colors for different point values

**Turn-taking** (if applicable): Use a simple system where one child performs while others wait in a designated rest area, then rotate. Keep wait times under 1 minute.

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)
Allow children to practice their favorite skills without instruction. Let them choose between sprinting, jumping, or throwing.
- Encourage children to try combining movements: "Can you sprint and then jump?"
- Observe what they naturally gravitate toward
- Provide gentle guidance without criticism

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually lower heart rate, reduce excitement level, transition back to calm activities, and celebrate achievements

**Cool-down activities**:
1. **Slow walking** - Walk around the field at an easy pace. "Let's slow down our running and catch our breath."
2. **Shoulder and neck rolls** - Gently roll shoulders backward and rotate neck. "Let's loosen up our muscles."
3. **Standing stretch** - Gentle hamstring, quadriceps, and arm stretches. "Feel the stretch in your legs."
4. **Breathing exercise** - Deep breathing: "Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth. In... and out..."

**Transition**: "Great job today, athletes! Your body worked so hard. Let's relax and get ready for snack time."

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Shorten distances significantly (10-15 feet for sprinting)
- Use larger, lighter balls (soft foam or beach balls)
- Focus mainly on running and basic throwing motions
- Simplify instructions to one key point at a time
- Provide more hands-on support and guidance
- Expect shorter attention spans (rotate activities every 60-90 seconds)
- Emphasize play over performance

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes total

**Adult support**: Significant—expect to run alongside, demonstrate each movement multiple times, and provide physical encouragement. Hold hands during running if needed.

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Increase sprinting distance (30-40 feet)
- Introduce relay races with teammates
- Add obstacles to sprinting lanes (step over cones, navigate around markers)
- Longer throwing distances and smaller targets
- Introduce personal records ("Can you jump farther than last time?")
- Add competitive elements (winning ribbons, certificates)
- Teach proper lane etiquette (no cutting across other lanes)

**Duration**: Can extend to 20-25 minutes with variety

## Extension Ideas

**Week 2-3 activities**:
- Create an obstacle course combining sprinting, jumping, and throwing
- Introduce simple relay races with 2-3 person teams
- Make paper certificates for "Track and Field Star" achievements
- Create personal record charts to track improvements
- Set up a "Field Day" with simple competitions

**Rainy day alternatives**:
- Indoor sprinting down a hallway with soft padding
- Jumping and landing drills in living room with tape on floor
- Foam ball throwing at bucket targets indoors
- Create an indoor obstacle course with furniture and cushions

## Safety and Supervision

**Key safety rules**:
- Children must wear proper footwear with good grip
- No running directly toward other children (designated lanes)
- All throwing must be into safe target zones away from others
- Children walk back to start (no running while tired and inattentive)
- Rest breaks are mandatory between sprints
- Adults supervise at all times—one adult per 4-6 children ideal

**When to stop or modify**:
- If child shows signs of dizziness or shortness of breath (rest immediately)
- If weather becomes too hot (move to shaded area, take water breaks)
- If children begin getting reckless or not following safety rules
- If surface becomes wet or unsafe

**First aid considerations**:
- Keep first aid kit nearby
- Know location of restrooms (children may need quick bathroom breaks)
- Have water readily available
- Know CPR/emergency procedures

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

**What to say**:
- "Look at how fast you're running! You're getting stronger!"
- "Great effort—you jumped even farther than before!"
- "Your arm is getting so strong for throwing!"
- "I love how you're trying hard and doing your best!"
- "Everyone runs at their own speed—focus on your own progress!"

**What to avoid**:
- Comparing children to each other ("You're slower than...")
- Focusing on winning/losing rather than effort
- Forcing participation (let them warm up to activities)
- Saying "that was bad" or using negative language

**When to help**: Provide physical guidance (holding hands, spotting) when child is learning, but step back once they show confidence. Let them struggle productively with technique—give hints instead of doing it for them.

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child refuses to sprint or run fast
**Why**: Fear of falling, lack of confidence, or overstimulation
**Solution**: Start with slow jogs, let them run alongside you, celebrate small attempts, ensure they see other children enjoying it first
**Timeline**: May take 3-4 sessions; don't force it

**Challenge**: Throwing lacks accuracy or strength
**Why**: Upper body strength and coordination still developing, learning to coordinate arm and shoulder
**Solution**: Use lighter balls, move targets closer, demonstrate arm motion slowly, practice indoors first for shorter distances
**Timeline**: Usually improves significantly within 2-3 weeks

**Challenge**: Gets winded quickly after short sprint
**Why**: Cardiovascular system still developing, may not breathe properly
**Solution**: Keep sprints shorter, ensure water breaks, teach them to breathe steadily, accept shorter effort periods
**Timeline**: Stamina improves with regular practice over weeks/months

**Challenge**: Doesn't wait turn or respects boundaries
**Why**: Impulse control and body awareness still developing; too much waiting time
**Solution**: Shorten wait times, use visual markers for boundaries, practice with smaller groups, celebrate good choices
**Timeline**: Improves with consistent practice and clear expectations

### Safety Reminders

- Always ensure children wear proper athletic shoes with good traction
- Check running surface for holes, uneven spots, or debris before starting
- Maintain adequate spacing between children during running and throwing
- Stop activity immediately if child shows signs of exhaustion, dizziness, or pain
- Ensure adequate shade and water, especially in warm weather
- Supervise at all times—never leave children unattended
- Check weather conditions; avoid extreme heat, cold, or wet conditions

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Sprinting with better upright posture and arm pumping
- Jumping with coordinated arm swing and two-foot landing
- Throwing with improved accuracy and smoother release
- Running for longer distances without excessive fatigue
- Improved confidence and willingness to try harder challenges
- Better understanding of boundaries and safety rules

**When to add challenge**:
- When child completes sprints easily without heavy breathing
- When throwing consistently hits targets
- When showing confidence in jumping and landing
- When can maintain focus for full 20-25 minute session
- When spontaneously trying harder variations
