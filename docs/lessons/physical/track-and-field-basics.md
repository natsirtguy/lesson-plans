# Track and Field (Running, Jumping, Throwing)

## Activity Summary

Track and field basics introduce children to fundamental athletic movements through running, jumping, and throwing—the cornerstone skills of sports and physical development. This activity builds gross motor strength, coordination, balance, and body awareness while making movement fun and achievement-oriented. Children develop confidence in their physical abilities and establish positive relationships with active play, laying the foundation for lifelong athletic engagement.

**Activity Type**: Individual Sport

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: High

**Best Environment**: Outdoor open space

**Space Required**: Large open area (minimum 30x30 feet ideal, but 20x20 feet minimum)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Soft foam ball (4-6 inches) - easy to catch and safe for young hands
- Cones or markers (4-6) - to mark starting lines, finish lines, and zones
- Low hurdle, rolled towel, or rope on ground - for jumping practice
- Soft beanbag (optional for throwing, safer than ball initially)

**Optional enhancements**:
- Hula hoop - marks target zones for throwing
- Chalk - for drawing start/finish lines
- Timer or music - to set activity pace and signal transitions
- Playground ball or kickball - for exploration after basics mastered
- Small obstacles - for running around

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use rolled socks or small balls of yarn for throwing practice
- Draw lines in dirt or sand instead of using cones
- Use a pillow or cushion as a low jumping obstacle
- Tie a rope between two low objects as a jumping line
- Use household items (plastic bottles, empty boxes) as markers

**Cost estimate**: Free (household items)

**Safety equipment**: None required, but consider:
- Soft throwing objects (foam ball or beanbag)
- Clear running area free of hazards
- Padded surface preferred (grass, sand, or playground)

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear a large open area free of obstacles, rocks, or hazards
2. Check for uneven ground or holes that could cause tripping
3. Ensure sun isn't in children's eyes during the activity
4. Mark clear boundaries with cones or chalk (optional but helpful)
5. Have water available for hydration breaks

**Boundaries**:
- Use cones, chalk lines, or flags to mark a rectangular area
- Create a "running zone" (straight line for sprints)
- Mark a "throwing zone" (safe area away from other children)
- Establish a "jumping zone" with low obstacles

**Safety considerations**:
- **Running and collision**: Practice running in the same direction; use ample space between children
- **Throwing and injury**: Ensure throwing area is clear; teach children to check behind before throwing
- **Tripping hazards**: Scan ground before activity; remove small objects that could cause falls
- **Overexertion**: Provide frequent short breaks; watch for signs of fatigue or overheating
- **Environmental**: Check temperature; ensure surface is appropriate (grass preferred over hard pavement)
- **Age-appropriate distances**: Younger children need shorter distances to avoid frustration

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Wake up muscles, increase heart rate, and prepare body for athletic movement without injury risk.

**Warm-up activities**:
1. **March in place** - Lift knees high, swing arms, gradually build energy. Say: "Let's march like strong soldiers! Lift those knees!"
2. **Arm circles** - Slow circles forward and backward, loosening shoulders. Say: "Make big circles with your arms like windmills!"
3. **Gentle jogging in place** - Light bouncing, not full running. Say: "Now let's bounce like little bunnies!"

**Warm-up cues**:
- "We're waking up our bodies so we can run fast, jump high, and throw far!"
- Make it playful: "Shake out your arms and legs!"
- For younger 2-3 year-olds: Keep it very brief and simple

### Main Activity (10-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- **Introduce the three skills**: "Today we're going to practice running (point), jumping (demonstrate low jump), and throwing (mime gentle throw)—just like athletes do!"
- **Demonstrate each movement once**: Run a short distance, jump over a low line, throw a soft ball
- **Key coaching point**: "We have fun AND we try our best. If something is hard, that just means we're learning!"

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:
1. **Running**: Start with standing, then jogging, then short sprints
   - Teach proper form: lean slightly forward, pump arms, lift knees
   - Start with slow jogs before sprinting

2. **Jumping**: Progress from standing jumps to jumping over low obstacles
   - Feet together, bend knees, swing arms forward and up, jump
   - Land gently on both feet, balance

3. **Throwing**: Teach basic underhand then overhand throw
   - Hold soft object at chest
   - Step forward, rotate hips, release with gentle follow-through
   - Start with beanbags or soft balls, very short distances

**Coaching cues**:
- **For running**: "Pump your arms like pistons! Faster, faster! You're a speedy race car!"
- **For jumping**: "Bend those knees like springs! Ready, set, JUMP!"
- **For throwing**: "Keep your eye on where you're throwing! Nice and easy at first—accuracy, not strength!"
- **Encouragement**: "Every time you try, you're getting better! That's what athletes do!"

#### Guided Play/Game (5-8 minutes)

**Game structure**: Combine all three skills in a fun circuit or relay format.

**Option 1: Track and Field Circuit**
- Station 1: Run from cone to cone (30 feet)
- Station 2: Jump over a low line or rolled towel
- Station 3: Throw soft ball at a hula hoop target (from 6-8 feet away)
- Go through circuit 2-3 times, resting between rounds

**Option 2: Progressive Races**
- Round 1: Walk to a marker (everyone finishes happy)
- Round 2: Jog to marker
- Round 3: Run to marker
- Celebrate each completion

**Option 3: Simon Says Track & Field**
- Call out movements: "Run in place!" "Jump high!" "Throw to me!"
- Children follow; no wrong answers, all participation celebrated

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Always stop at the boundary markers
2. Look before you throw (check area is clear)
3. If someone needs help, we help them—everyone is a good sport

**Variations**:
- **For older/advanced**: Add distance to running, height to jumping, increase throw distance
- **For younger/struggling**: Shorten distances, lower jump obstacles, reduce throwing distance
- **Make it competitive**: "Can you beat your own best time?" (no comparing children)
- **Add music**: Run/jump/throw to music beat

**Turn-taking** (if applicable):
- Small groups work best (2-4 children)
- While one child runs, others cheer and do standing jumps
- Rotate who goes first each round for fairness

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

Let children experiment with movements in the space—this is pure fun with light structure.

**What to encourage**:
- "Try jumping higher than before!"
- "Can you throw even softer and land it closer?"
- "Make up your own running game!"

**When to observe**:
- Watch developing skills and offer quiet encouragement
- Notice which activities each child enjoys most
- Observe any movement limitations or concerns

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually lower heart rate, calm excitement, help transition to next activity.

**Cool-down activities**:
1. **Slow walking** - Walk slowly around the space, deep breathing
2. **Arm and leg stretches** - Gentle reaching, no bouncing
3. **Breathing exercise** - "Smell the flowers, blow the bubbles" (slow inhale, exhale)

**Transition**:
"Great job, athletes! You worked so hard. Now let's calm our bodies down. We're going to walk slowly and take some deep breaths together. Feel how good your muscles are working!"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Simplify to one or two skills per session (running and jumping, skip throwing)
- Use very short distances (10-15 feet maximum)
- Jumping: Start with stepping over lines before true jumping
- Throwing: Use underhand throw only, beanbags easier than balls
- Expect limited attention span; break activities into very short segments
- Heavy adult modeling and participation

**Duration**: 8-10 minutes total (shorter attention span)

**Adult support**:
- Stand very close and demonstrate movements
- Use hand-over-hand guidance for throwing if needed
- Celebrate every attempt enthusiastically
- Be prepared to redirect frequently
- Participate alongside children, not just observing

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Combine all three skills in sequences or relays
- Increase running distances (20-30 feet)
- Add jump height or obstacles (jump over rolled towel, small box)
- Increase throw distance (8-12 feet) and introduce accuracy targets
- Introduce simple competition: "Can you beat your best throw?" (self-competition, not peer)
- Practice short sprints with starting line and "Go!" signal
- Add directional changes: figure-8 running, slalom running around cones

**Duration**: Can extend to 15-20 minutes with longer focus

**Additional skills**:
- Basic sprinting technique
- Multi-step approach before throwing
- Two-foot takeoff for jumping
- Directional agility and control

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**:
  - "Look how high you jumped! Your legs are so strong!"
  - "That throw went really far—your arm is getting stronger every day!"
  - "I can see you're working hard. That's what makes us better!"
  - "Everyone does these things differently, and that's perfect!"

- **What to avoid**:
  - Comparing children ("You ran faster than Emma")
  - Focusing on winning/losing (emphasize effort and improvement)
  - Forcing participation if scared or tired
  - Perfectionistic demands ("You can do better")
  - Negative comments ("That was too short")

- **When to help**:
  - Physically guide an unsure child through movement once
  - Support if scared (let them watch first, join when ready)
  - Reduce difficulty if child is frustrated; increase if bored
  - Help them up if they fall; normalize falls as part of learning
  - Practice hand-over-hand throwing if child struggles with motion

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child doesn't want to run fast/try hard; prefers walking slowly

**Why**: Fear of losing control, lack of confidence, or lower energy temperament. This is normal development.

**Solution**:
- Don't force; celebrate walking
- Model jogging as "medium fast" alternative
- Use imagery: "Can you jog like a dinosaur?" (slower, heavier step)
- Break runs into very short distances
- Practice starting from a line: "Ready, set, GO!"

**Timeline**: With repeated exposure and success, most children will build confidence by 2-3 weeks.

---

**Challenge**: Child throws inconsistently; sometimes too hard, sometimes won't release

**Why**: Fine motor control and arm strength still developing. Understanding force is difficult.

**Solution**:
- Use very soft objects (beanbags, yarn balls)
- Practice releasing hand from throwing motion separately
- Use short distances (3-4 feet at first)
- Play "gentle throwing" games: "Can we throw soft like snowflakes?"
- Try underhand throw first (more natural motion)
- Let them throw against a wall or into a hoop instead of to a person

**Timeline**: Throwing accuracy and control typically improves significantly by age 4-5.

---

**Challenge**: Child jumps on one foot instead of two feet; can't seem to jump

**Why**: Bilateral coordination and leg strength still developing. Many 2-3 year-olds can't jump yet—this is normal.

**Solution**:
- Start with stepping over lines before jumping
- Practice "pop" motion: bend knees and stand up fast without moving
- Hold child's hand and jump together
- Use low obstacles (rolled towel)
- Celebrate stepping as "practicing to jump"
- Avoid forcing—jumping emerges naturally around age 3

**Timeline**: True jumping typically emerges between ages 2.5-3.5 years.

---

**Challenge**: Child loses interest/attention after 5-10 minutes

**Why**: Age-appropriate attention span; needs variety and novelty.

**Solution**:
- Switch skills frequently (don't do same skill for more than 3 minutes)
- Add music or change environment
- Introduce silly variations ("Run backwards!")
- Play different games rather than repetitive drills
- Notice what engages them and emphasize that element
- End on a high note when interest is still present

**Timeline**: Attention span naturally increases with age; 3-4 year-olds gradually sustain 10-15 minutes.

### Safety Reminders

- **Clear the space**: Before running activities, ensure no obstacles, holes, or hazards
- **Check throwing zone**: Ensure no other children in the throwing target area
- **Soft objects only**: Always use foam balls, beanbags, or yarn balls—never hard objects
- **Supervise closely**: One adult per 3-4 young children during athletic activities
- **Watch for overheating**: Young children regulate temperature poorly; take frequent shade/water breaks
- **Appropriate footwear**: Shoes or bare feet (never socks on hard surfaces)
- **Stop if child is hurt**: Take any fall or injury seriously; check before resuming
- **When to take a break**: If child shows signs of fatigue, overheating (flushed, heavy breathing), frustration, or loss of interest

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- **Running**: Increases speed; better balance while running; can stop on command
- **Jumping**: Progresses from stepping to two-foot takeoff; gradually gets height and distance
- **Throwing**: Better distance; improved accuracy; more consistent release

**Progression over weeks/months**:
- Week 1-2: Getting comfortable with movements; celebrating effort
- Week 3-4: Noticing small improvements in control and distance
- Month 2: Can combine skills in simple sequences; shows confidence
- Month 3: Increased speed, height, distance; asking to repeat activities

**When to add challenge**:
- Child completes activity without struggle and asks "Can we do harder?"
- Can consistently perform skill (90% success rate)
- Shows readiness for longer distances or more complex movements
- No longer interested in current level (boredom cues)
