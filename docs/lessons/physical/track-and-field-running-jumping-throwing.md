# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Track and Field (Running, Jumping, Throwing)

## Activity Summary

Track and field activities develop fundamental athletic skills across running, jumping, and throwing movements. These classic athletic disciplines build explosive power, speed, coordination, and body awareness while encouraging friendly competition and personal goal-setting. Children develop confidence through mastering individual skills and enjoy the motivational aspects of friendly races and distance challenges.

**Activity Type**: Sport-based athletic skill development

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: High

**Best Environment**: Outdoor open space, track or field, large backyard, park

**Space Required**: Large open area (at least 30x50 feet minimum)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Soft foam or rubber balls (4-6 inches diameter) - for throwing practice
- Cones or markers (6-8 items) - to mark lanes and finish lines
- Soft landing surface (grass, mat, or sand pit) - for safe jumping
- Measuring tape or rope - to mark distances
- Starting line (chalk, tape, or rope) - to define beginning point

**Optional enhancements**:
- Small hurdles or low obstacles (6-12 inches) - for jumping variety
- Beanbags - alternative to balls for throwing
- Agility ladder or stepping markers - for footwork practice
- Stopwatch - to track improvements over time
- Finish line flags or ribbons - visual motivation

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use rolled socks or lightweight fabric scraps instead of balls
- Mark lanes with chalk on concrete or flour on grass
- Use toys, boxes, or cushions as low obstacles
- Make finish line with tape or rope

**Cost estimate**: Free to under $15 (most supplies are household items or inexpensive)

**Safety equipment**:
- Soft foam balls (not hard or heavy)
- Grass or padded landing surface
- Open field free from obstacles

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear large open area of obstacles, rocks, and tripping hazards
2. Inspect grass or ground surface for holes, sticks, or sharp objects
3. Define running lanes with cones or chalk (each lane 6-10 feet wide)
4. Create safe landing zone for jumps with soft surface
5. Set up throwing area away from people and with clear target zone
6. Mark starting line, checkpoint markers, and finish line

**Boundaries**:
- Use cones to define running lanes
- Chalk marks or rope to show finish lines
- Clear visual boundary for throwing area
- Safe perimeter around all activities

**Safety considerations**:
- Ensure clear running paths free of obstacles and uneven terrain
- Soft landing surface mandatory for all jumping activities
- Keep throwing area separate from running zone to prevent collisions
- No hard or projectile objects in throwing practice
- Supervision within arm's reach for children under 3
- Adequate space between participants (minimum 10 feet)
- Check weather: avoid extreme heat, wet surfaces, or lightning

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare muscles and joints for athletic movements, elevate heart rate gradually, establish focus and excitement

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Walking then light jogging in place - "Let's get our feet ready to move fast!" Start slow, gradually pick up pace
2. Arm circles and shoulder rolls - "Make big circles with your arms like windmills"
3. High-knee marching - "Bring your knees up high like you're stepping over invisible puddles"

**Warm-up cues**:
- "We're warming up our bodies so they're ready to run, jump, and throw"
- "Can you jog in place with me? One, two, one, two..."
- "Shake out your arms and legs - we're about to have fun!"

### Main Activity (10-18 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- Explain that track and field has three main events: running races, jumping contests, and throwing challenges
- Demonstrate proper running form: lean forward slightly, pump arms, look ahead
- Show one jumping technique: bend knees, swing arms, jump upward
- Model throwing motion: feet shoulder-width apart, step and throw

#### Skill Practice (4-8 minutes)

**Running skill breakdown**:
- Posture: slight forward lean, eyes forward, arms pumping at sides
- Leg drive: lift knees high, push off ground powerfully
- Breathing: natural breathing, not holding breath
- Finishing: maintain form to the very end

**Jumping skill breakdown**:
- Starting position: feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent
- Arm swing: swing arms backward to prepare, then forward forcefully
- Takeoff: push off with both feet at same time
- Landing: land softly on both feet, bend knees to absorb impact

**Throwing skill breakdown**:
- Stance: feet shoulder-width apart, side toward target
- Grip: hold ball firmly in palm, not fingers alone
- Motion: bring ball to chest, step forward, extend arm and release
- Follow-through: arm continues across body after release

**Coaching cues**:
- "Run like your favorite animal - fast and strong!"
- "Pump your arms to help you go faster"
- "Bend your knees before you jump - crouch like a frog"
- "Swing your arms up when you jump to help you go higher"
- "Step toward your target when you throw"
- "Follow through - let your arm go all the way"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-8 minutes)

**Game structure**: Rotate through three 2-3 minute stations

**Running races**:
- Short sprint races (20-30 feet) with 2-3 children at a time
- Mark clear start and finish lines
- Celebrate effort, not just winning: "Look how fast you ran!"
- Vary races: straight line, around cones, backward, sideways

**Jumping contests**:
- Standing long jump: how far can you jump from starting line
- High jump: place soft object at increasing heights, see if they can jump over
- Broad jump: run short distance then jump - measure distance
- Vertical hop: how many times can you jump in place in 30 seconds

**Throwing challenges**:
- Target toss: throw balls at markers or large targets
- Distance throw: see how far you can throw
- Accuracy contest: try to hit a bucket or hoop
- Partner toss: gentle underhand throws back and forth

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Everyone walks to the starting line - no running until you hear "Go!"
2. Cheer for your friends when they're doing their turn
3. If you fall, that's okay - just get up and keep going

**Variations**:
- For younger children: shorter distances, lower heights, softer throws
- For older children: longer races, higher jumps, greater throwing distance
- Mix activities: running then jumping, jumping then throwing
- Create obstacle course combining all three skills
- Time individual improvements over sessions

**Turn-taking**:
- Divide into small groups of 2-3
- While waiting, they can practice form movements or watch and cheer
- Keep lines moving quickly so no one waits more than 1 minute

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

Let children experiment with movements:
- Try different running styles and speeds
- Invent their own jumping patterns
- Practice throwing in different ways
- Combine skills in sequences

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually lower heart rate, calm excited energy, reflect on accomplishments

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow walking around the field - "Let's slow our bodies down after all that hard work"
2. Standing stretches - gentle quad, hamstring, and shoulder stretches
3. Deep breathing - "Breathe in slowly through your nose, out through your mouth"

**Transition**:
- "We worked really hard with our bodies today"
- "Let's slow down and feel calm now"
- "Think about which activity was your favorite"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Simplify to one activity per session (focus on running OR jumping OR throwing, not all three)
- Much shorter distances: 10-15 feet for running
- Lower heights for jumping: jump onto cushion, not over objects
- Larger, lighter balls for throwing (soft foam, 6-8 inches)
- Underhand throws only - more developmentally appropriate
- More adult support and demonstration
- Celebrate any attempt equally with successful execution
- Focus on movement joy, not performance metrics

**Duration**: 8-12 minutes total (shorter attention span)

**Adult support**:
- Stay very close, ready to catch or steady
- Demonstrate each movement multiple times
- Use hand-over-hand guidance when needed
- Frequent encouragement and celebration of effort

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Combine all three activities in one session
- Increase running distance to 30-50 feet
- Add jumping variety: forward, backward, side-to-side
- Include some overhand throwing practice
- Introduce simple scoring or measuring (count jumps, measure distance)
- Add obstacles to jump over or run around
- Partner or relay activities
- Self-timing or comparing to previous attempts
- More complex games with basic rules

**Duration**: Can extend to 20-25 minutes

## Extension Ideas

### Multi-Session Progression

**Week 1**: Focus on form and technique
- Daily running practice with emphasis on proper posture
- Jumping from standing position, then adding approach
- Throwing accuracy at stationary targets

**Week 2**: Add distance and competition
- Longer sprints, measuring progress
- Higher jumps or longer jump distances
- Throwing for distance instead of accuracy

**Week 3**: Combine and create
- Relay races (running with handoff)
- Multi-event competitions (run-jump-throw sequence)
- Obstacle course combining all three skills

**Week 4**: Track improvements
- Time sprints and compare to earlier sessions
- Measure jump distances and track growth
- Create personal bests and celebrate improvements

### Related Activities to Add
- Relay races with partners or teams
- Sack races (running in constrained way)
- Three-legged running with partner
- Bean bag toss or cornhole (throwing accuracy)
- High jump or limbo (different jumping challenges)
- Cone weaving runs (coordination and agility)
- Baton passing (motor control and coordination)

## Safety and Supervision

### Active Supervision Requirements
- One adult minimum for groups up to 6 children
- Must maintain visual contact at all times
- Position yourself centrally where all activities are visible
- Watch for signs of fatigue or overexertion

### Common Injury Prevention
- No running on wet or slippery surfaces
- Check footwear is secure (tied shoes, no sandals)
- Inspect surface for hazards before starting
- Ensure adequate spacing between running lanes
- Keep throwing area separate from running/jumping zones
- Use only soft, age-appropriate throwing objects

### Heat and Weather Safety
- Provide water breaks every 10 minutes
- Avoid intense activity during peak heat
- Watch for signs of overheating: excessive sweating, flushed face, dizziness
- Stop immediately in threatening weather
- Protect from sun with shade breaks or sunscreen

### When to Modify or Stop
- Child shows excessive fatigue or difficulty breathing
- Temperature exceeds 85-90°F (too hot)
- Surface becomes wet or unsafe
- Child expresses fear or refusal to participate
- Any sign of injury or pain during movement

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

**What to say**:
- "Look at how fast you're running! Feel your legs working hard?"
- "You jumped so high! I could see your feet leave the ground!"
- "Great throw! The ball went so far!"
- "Every time you practice, you get stronger and better"
- "I'm proud of how hard you tried, not just the result"

**What to avoid**:
- Comparing children to each other ("You're not as fast as...")
- Focusing only on winning ("Who came in first?")
- Expressing frustration at mistakes
- Pushing when child shows fatigue
- Making it about performance instead of enjoyment

**When to help**:
- Offer hand support when child is learning to jump
- Demonstrate movements they haven't seen before
- Provide encouragement when they're nervous
- Help them understand distances or measurements
- Step back and let them try independently once confident

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child refuses to run or says "I can't run fast"
**Why**: May have compared themselves to others, feel uncoordinated, or lack confidence
**Solution**: Start with very short distances, offer hand to hold, praise effort not speed, run together slowly
**Timeline**: Confidence typically builds within 2-3 sessions

**Challenge**: Child falls during running and becomes upset
**Why**: Normal developmental clumsiness, may fear falling, or hurt themselves slightly
**Solution**: Reassure that falling is normal, check for real injury, encourage trying again, offer hand support
**Timeline**: Fear of falling usually decreases with experience and success

**Challenge**: Throwing is wild and inaccurate, child becomes frustrated
**Why**: Fine motor control still developing, arm strength limited, coordination developing
**Solution**: Use larger targets, move closer to target, emphasize fun over accuracy, practice underhand throws
**Timeline**: Control and accuracy improve significantly ages 3-4+

**Challenge**: Child tires quickly and wants to stop
**Why**: High-intensity activity, cardiovascular endurance still building, may need water break
**Solution**: Offer water, slow the pace, include walking breaks, mix intense and moderate activities
**Timeline**: Endurance builds naturally with regular activity

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Running with better posture and arm coordination
- Jumping higher or farther than previous attempts
- Throwing with increased accuracy and distance
- Staying active longer without becoming tired
- Attempting more complex movements (jumping obstacles, longer runs)
- Building confidence and willingness to try new challenges

**When to add challenge**:
- Child completes sprints without tiring noticeably
- Jumping becomes confident and landing is controlled
- Throwing demonstrates improved accuracy
- Child asks for longer distances or harder activities
- Shows interest in measuring or tracking progress

### Skill Development Timeline

**Weeks 1-2**: Building comfort and confidence
- Getting used to effort and exertion
- Learning correct form through repetition
- Building courage for higher or longer activities

**Weeks 3-4**: Improving technique and consistency
- Form becoming more natural
- Distances and heights increasing
- Competing with self (trying to beat own record)

**Weeks 5-8**: Building stamina and advancing skills
- Can do multiple repetitions without exhaustion
- Beginning to understand strategy
- Ready for more complex activities like relays or obstacle courses
