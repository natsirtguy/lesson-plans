# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Track and Field (Running, Jumping, Throwing)

## Activity Summary

Track and field activities develop fundamental athletic skills across running, jumping, and throwing movements. These aren't just "exercise" — they're applications of physics and physiology that children's bodies are already demonstrating without knowing it.

**Running** is powered by Newton's Third Law: each foot pushes backward against the ground, and the ground pushes the runner forward with equal force (ground reaction force). The faster you push back, the faster you accelerate. Efficient runners lean slightly forward, keeping their center of mass ahead of their feet so gravity assists acceleration. Arm swing isn't decorative — it counterbalances the rotation of the legs and shoulders, keeping the body from twisting.

**Jumping** uses the **stretch-shortening cycle**: bending the knees rapidly stretches the muscles and tendons like a spring, storing elastic energy. When released, this energy adds to the muscular force of the jump. The arm swing is also biomechanically significant — swinging the arms up transfers angular momentum upward through the body, adding height to the jump.

**Throwing** is a chain of body rotations: hips rotate first, then torso, then shoulder, then elbow, then wrist — each link adding speed to the next in a **kinetic chain**. The ball follows projectile motion after release: a curved arc determined by launch angle and speed. The optimal angle for maximum distance is approximately 45 degrees (ignoring air resistance).

**Muscle physiology**: short sprints (under 30 seconds) rely on **fast-twitch muscle fibers** — powerful but quick to fatigue, burning stored glucose without oxygen (anaerobic respiration). Longer steady running uses **slow-twitch muscle fibers** — less powerful but highly efficient, burning fat and glucose with oxygen (aerobic respiration). Lactic acid builds up during anaerobic effort, which is why muscles feel burning and heavy after a hard sprint — a sign the muscles are running out of readily available oxygen.

**Activity Type**: Sport-based athletic skill development

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: High

**Best Environment**: Outdoor open space, track or field, large backyard, park

**Space Required**: Large open area (at least 30x50 feet minimum)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Soft foam or rubber balls (4-6 inches diameter) - for throwing practice
- Cones or markers (6-8 items) - to mark lanes and finish lines
- Soft landing surface (grass, mat, or sand pit) - for safe jumping
- Measuring tape or rope - to mark distances
- Starting line (chalk, tape, or rope) - to define beginning point

**Optional enhancements**:
- Small hurdles or low obstacles (6-12 inches) - for jumping variety
- Beanbags - alternative to balls for throwing
- Agility ladder or stepping markers - for footwork practice
- Stopwatch - to track improvements over time
- Finish line flags or ribbons - visual motivation

**DIY alternatives**:
- Use rolled socks or lightweight fabric scraps instead of balls
- Mark lanes with chalk on concrete or flour on grass
- Use toys, boxes, or cushions as low obstacles
- Make finish line with tape or rope

**Cost estimate**: Free to under $15 (most supplies are household items or inexpensive)

**Safety equipment**:
- Soft foam balls (not hard or heavy)
- Grass or padded landing surface
- Open field free from obstacles

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear large open area of obstacles, rocks, and tripping hazards
2. Inspect grass or ground surface for holes, sticks, or sharp objects
3. Define running lanes with cones or chalk (each lane 6-10 feet wide)
4. Create safe landing zone for jumps with soft surface
5. Set up throwing area away from people and with clear target zone
6. Mark starting line, checkpoint markers, and finish line

**Boundaries**:
- Use cones to define running lanes
- Chalk marks or rope to show finish lines
- Clear visual boundary for throwing area
- Safe perimeter around all activities

**Safety considerations**:
- Ensure clear running paths free of obstacles and uneven terrain
- Soft landing surface mandatory for all jumping activities
- Keep throwing area separate from running zone to prevent collisions
- No hard or projectile objects in throwing practice
- Supervision within arm's reach for children under 3
- Adequate space between participants (minimum 10 feet)
- Check weather: avoid extreme heat, wet surfaces, or lightning

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare muscles and joints for athletic movements, elevate heart rate gradually, establish focus and excitement

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Walking then light jogging in place - "Let's get our feet ready to move fast!" Start slow, gradually pick up pace
2. Arm circles and shoulder rolls - "Make big circles with your arms like windmills"
3. High-knee marching - "Bring your knees up high like you're stepping over invisible puddles"

**Warm-up cues**:
- "We're warming up our bodies so they're ready to run, jump, and throw"
- "Can you jog in place with me? One, two, one, two..."
- "Shake out your arms and legs - we're about to have fun!"

### Main Activity (10-18 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- Explain that track and field has three main events: running races, jumping contests, and throwing challenges
- Demonstrate proper running form: lean forward slightly, pump arms, look ahead
- Show one jumping technique: bend knees, swing arms, jump upward
- Model throwing motion: feet shoulder-width apart, step and throw

#### Skill Practice (4-8 minutes)

**Running skill breakdown**:
- Posture: slight forward lean — leaning moves the center of mass forward so ground reaction force is directed backward, propelling you forward rather than straight up
- Leg drive: lift knees high, push off ground powerfully — the push-back is what generates the forward reaction force (Newton's 3rd Law)
- Arm swing: pump arms at sides — counterbalances rotation and adds to stride rhythm; say "your arms help your legs go faster!"
- Breathing: breathe naturally; holding breath cuts oxygen to muscles
- Finishing: maintain form to the very end

**Jumping skill breakdown**:
- Starting position: feet shoulder-width apart, knees bent — this loads the stretch-shortening cycle (like compressing a spring)
- Arm swing: swing arms backward first (loading), then forcefully forward and up — the upward momentum transfers through the body, adding height
- Takeoff: push off both feet simultaneously — "you're storing energy in your bent knees and releasing it all at once, like a spring!"
- Landing: land softly on both feet, bend knees to absorb impact — the muscles act as shock absorbers, dissipating the kinetic energy gradually

**Throwing skill breakdown**:
- Stance: feet shoulder-width apart, side toward target — positions body for the kinetic chain rotation (hips first, then torso, then arm)
- Grip: hold ball in fingers, not palm — fingers act as a lever at the final link of the kinetic chain
- Motion: hips rotate first, then torso, then shoulder, then elbow, then wrist snap — each part adds speed to the next link in the chain
- Release and follow-through: arm continues across body — allows maximum transfer of momentum to the ball; stopping abruptly cuts power

**Coaching cues**:
- "Run like your favorite animal - fast and strong!"
- "Pump your arms to help you go faster"
- "Bend your knees before you jump - crouch like a frog"
- "Swing your arms up when you jump to help you go higher"
- "Step toward your target when you throw"
- "Follow through - let your arm go all the way"

#### Guided Play/Game (4-8 minutes)

**Game structure**: Rotate through three 2-3 minute stations

**Running races**:
- Short sprint races (20-30 feet) with 2-3 children at a time
- Mark clear start and finish lines
- Celebrate effort, not just winning: "Look how fast you ran!"
- Vary races: straight line, around cones, backward, sideways

**Jumping contests**:
- Standing long jump: how far can you jump from starting line
- High jump: place soft object at increasing heights, see if they can jump over
- Broad jump: run short distance then jump - measure distance
- Vertical hop: how many times can you jump in place in 30 seconds

**Throwing challenges**:
- Target toss: throw balls at markers or large targets
- Distance throw: see how far you can throw
- Accuracy contest: try to hit a bucket or hoop
- Partner toss: gentle underhand throws back and forth

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. Everyone walks to the starting line - no running until you hear "Go!"
2. Cheer for your friends when they're doing their turn
3. If you fall, that's okay - just get up and keep going

**Variations**:
- For younger children: shorter distances, lower heights, softer throws
- For older children: longer races, higher jumps, greater throwing distance
- Mix activities: running then jumping, jumping then throwing
- Create obstacle course combining all three skills
- Time individual improvements over sessions

**Turn-taking**:
- Divide into small groups of 2-3
- While waiting, they can practice form movements or watch and cheer
- Keep lines moving quickly so no one waits more than 1 minute

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

Let children experiment with movements:
- Try different running styles and speeds
- Invent their own jumping patterns
- Practice throwing in different ways
- Combine skills in sequences

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Gradually lower heart rate, calm excited energy, reflect on accomplishments

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Slow walking around the field - "Let's slow our bodies down after all that hard work"
2. Standing stretches - gentle quad, hamstring, and shoulder stretches
3. Deep breathing - "Breathe in slowly through your nose, out through your mouth"

**Transition**:
- "We worked really hard with our bodies today"
- "Let's slow down and feel calm now"
- "Think about which activity was your favorite"

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Simplify to one activity per session (focus on running OR jumping OR throwing, not all three)
- Much shorter distances: 10-15 feet for running
- Lower heights for jumping: jump onto cushion, not over objects
- Larger, lighter balls for throwing (soft foam, 6-8 inches)
- Underhand throws only - more developmentally appropriate
- More adult support and demonstration
- Celebrate any attempt equally with successful execution
- Focus on movement joy, not performance metrics

**Duration**: 8-12 minutes total (shorter attention span)

**Adult support**:
- Stay very close, ready to catch or steady
- Demonstrate each movement multiple times
- Use hand-over-hand guidance when needed
- Frequent encouragement and celebration of effort

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Combine all three activities in one session
- Increase running distance to 30-50 feet
- Add jumping variety: forward, backward, side-to-side
- Include some overhand throwing practice
- Introduce simple scoring or measuring (count jumps, measure distance)
- Add obstacles to jump over or run around
- Partner or relay activities
- Self-timing or comparing to previous attempts
- More complex games with basic rules

**Duration**: Can extend to 20-25 minutes

- Ensure adequate spacing between running lanes
- Keep throwing area separate from running/jumping zones
- Use only soft, age-appropriate throwing objects

### Heat and Weather Safety
- Provide water breaks every 10 minutes
- Avoid intense activity during peak heat
- Watch for signs of overheating: excessive sweating, flushed face, dizziness
- Stop immediately in threatening weather
- Protect from sun with shade breaks or sunscreen

### When to Modify or Stop
- Child shows excessive fatigue or difficulty breathing
- Temperature exceeds 85-90°F (too hot)
- Surface becomes wet or unsafe
- Child expresses fear or refusal to participate
- Any sign of injury or pain during movement

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

**What to say**:
- "Look at how fast you're running! Your legs are pushing the ground backward, and the ground pushes you forward — that's Newton's Third Law!"
- "You jumped so high! You loaded your legs like a spring and released all that energy!"
- "Great throw! The ball made an arc through the air — that's projectile motion!"
- "Feel that burning in your legs? That's lactic acid — your muscles were working so hard they ran out of oxygen for a moment!"
- "Every time you practice, you get stronger and better — your muscles and neurons are literally changing"

**What to avoid**:
- Comparing children to each other ("You're not as fast as...")
- Focusing only on winning ("Who came in first?")
- Expressing frustration at mistakes
- Pushing when child shows fatigue
- Making it about performance instead of enjoyment

**When to help**:
- Offer hand support when child is learning to jump
- Demonstrate movements they haven't seen before
- Provide encouragement when they're nervous
- Help them understand distances or measurements
- Step back and let them try independently once confident

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child refuses to run or says "I can't run fast"
**Why**: May have compared themselves to others, feel uncoordinated, or lack confidence
**Solution**: Start with very short distances, offer hand to hold, praise effort not speed, run together slowly
**Timeline**: Confidence typically builds within 2-3 sessions

**Challenge**: Child falls during running and becomes upset
**Why**: Normal developmental clumsiness, may fear falling, or hurt themselves slightly
**Solution**: Reassure that falling is normal, check for real injury, encourage trying again, offer hand support
**Timeline**: Fear of falling usually decreases with experience and success

**Challenge**: Throwing is wild and inaccurate, child becomes frustrated
**Why**: Fine motor control still developing, arm strength limited, coordination developing
**Solution**: Use larger targets, move closer to target, emphasize fun over accuracy, practice underhand throws
**Timeline**: Control and accuracy improve significantly ages 3-4+

**Challenge**: Child tires quickly and wants to stop
**Why**: High-intensity activity, cardiovascular endurance still building, may need water break
**Solution**: Offer water, slow the pace, include walking breaks, mix intense and moderate activities
**Timeline**: Endurance builds naturally with regular activity

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Running with better posture and arm coordination
- Jumping higher or farther than previous attempts
- Throwing with increased accuracy and distance
- Staying active longer without becoming tired
- Attempting more complex movements (jumping obstacles, longer runs)
- Building confidence and willingness to try new challenges

**When to add challenge**:
- Child completes sprints without tiring noticeably
- Jumping becomes confident and landing is controlled
- Throwing demonstrates improved accuracy
- Child asks for longer distances or harder activities
- Shows interest in measuring or tracking progress

### Skill Development Timeline

**Weeks 1-2**: Building comfort and confidence
- Getting used to effort and exertion
- Learning correct form through repetition
- Building courage for higher or longer activities

**Weeks 3-4**: Improving technique and consistency
- Form becoming more natural
- Distances and heights increasing
- Competing with self (trying to beat own record)

**Weeks 5-8**: Building stamina and advancing skills
- Can do multiple repetitions without exhaustion
- Beginning to understand strategy
- Ready for more complex activities like relays or obstacle courses
