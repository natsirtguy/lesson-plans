# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Water Safety and Rescue Practice

## Activity Summary

Water safety and rescue practice teaches young children fundamental skills for being safe around water, including basic water awareness, flotation comfort, and simple rescue concepts. This activity builds confidence in and around water while establishing critical safety habits that protect children in aquatic environments. These foundational skills are essential for water safety and create positive associations with water that support lifelong water competency.

**Activity Type**: Aquatic Sports/Safety skill development

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Moderate

**Best Environment**: Swimming pool with shallow area (6-12 inches deep), bathtub, or water table

**Space Required**: Small water area with safe access

## Key Concepts

**Buoyancy**: The upward force that water exerts on objects placed in it. Water pushes back against anything that enters it — that's why objects float. Your body floats because water pushes up on you with a force equal to the weight of the water your body displaces (pushes aside). Relaxing your muscles makes your body spread out and displace more water, which is why a relaxed body floats better than a tense one.

**Density**: How much mass is packed into a given space. Objects less dense than water float; objects more dense sink. The human body is close to water's density, which is why we float when we breathe in (air in lungs makes us less dense) and tend to sink when we exhale.

**Aspiration**: When liquid enters the airways (trachea and lungs) instead of going down the esophagus to the stomach. Even a small amount of water aspirated into the lungs interferes with gas exchange — the process where lungs transfer oxygen into the blood and remove carbon dioxide. This is why swallowing water while swimming is uncomfortable, and why water in the airway is genuinely dangerous.

**Involuntary response**: Drowning is dangerous partly because a person in water distress cannot shout — the body automatically closes the throat to prevent water entry, making rescue detection difficult. This is why adult supervision must be visual and constant, not listening-based.

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Shallow water container (pool, bathtub, or large plastic basin) - minimum 6 inches deep, maximum 12 inches for ages 2-3
- Adult supervision (1:1 ratio for ages 2-3)
- Towels - several absorbent towels for drying
- Non-slip bath mat or pool safety mat - placed inside water area
- Rescue flotation device - adult-sized life vest or ring for demonstration

**Optional enhancements**:
- Small flotation devices sized for toddlers (water wings, kickboards, or noodles) - for confidence building
- Colorful bath toys - to make water play enjoyable
- Washcloths - for water comfort activities
- Inflatable ring or pool noodle - for guided flotation practice
- Water thermometer - to ensure appropriate temperature (85-92°F for young children)

**DIY alternatives**:
- Large plastic bin or kiddie pool instead of full swimming pool
- Regular bath towels instead of specialized pool towels
- Household items like plastic cups and sponges for water play
- Stuffed animals for mock rescue practice

**Cost estimate**: Free (household items) or Under $10 (if using existing pool or bath)

**Safety equipment**:
- Adult life vest or rescue device
- First aid kit nearby
- Phone accessible for emergencies

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Check water temperature (85-92°F is ideal for young children)
2. Clear the water area of any sharp objects, glass, or hazards
3. Place non-slip mat on bottom of water container
4. Ensure water depth is appropriate (6-12 inches for ages 2-3 maximum)
5. Have all equipment within arm's reach of the water
6. Clear the surrounding area of trip hazards
7. Establish a clear, dry changing area

**Boundaries**:
- Mark the edge of the water area clearly with towels or tape
- Establish a "dry zone" at least 3 feet away from water
- Use verbal reminders: "We walk slowly around the water" and "Water stays in this area"
- Create a designated safe spot for non-swimmers to wait

**Safety considerations**:
- Constant adult supervision - never leave child unattended near water, even for seconds
- Appropriate water depth - no deeper than child's waist when standing
- Water temperature monitoring - check before each session
- Entry and exit - use steps or gentle ramps, no jumping in
- Slipping prevention - non-slip surfaces at all water edges
- Drowning prevention - watch for silent drowning (child may not call for help)
- Choking hazard - keep small toys and objects away from water area

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Transition from regular play to water activities, build anticipation, and prepare the body for water safety practice.

**Warm-up activities**:
1. Walking around the water area - Walk slowly and carefully around the water container while talking about what we'll do. Use phrases like: "We're going to learn how to be safe near water today!"
2. Stretching by the water - Gentle arm circles, side bends, and leg stretches while sitting safely on the ground near the water. Say: "Let's stretch our arms like starfish arms ready for the water!"
3. Splashing movement preview - Sitting safely at the water's edge (not in the water yet), practice gentle hand splashing motions. Say: "We're going to make the water dance! Splash, splash!"

**Warm-up cues**:
- "Let's get ready for water fun!"
- "Keep your feet on the ground as we walk"
- "We're learning to be water smart today"

### Main Activity (10-15 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (2 minutes)
- Show the child the water area. Explain concretely why water needs care: "Water can get inside your lungs — the air bags inside your chest — and when water fills them, they can't bring oxygen to your blood. That's why we're always careful and always have an adult right here."
- Drop a small object in the water and ask: "What happened? Water pushed it back up — that's called **buoyancy**. The water pushes back on everything. Your body is so close to water's weight that it can float too, and we're going to practice that."
- Demonstrate calm water entry by sitting at the edge, then gently sliding into the water with support
- Point out the non-slip mat: "This bumpy mat keeps us safe so we don't slip — wet surfaces are extra slippery because water acts as a lubricant between your feet and the ground"
- Establish the key safety rule: "An adult is always with us in the water"

#### Skill Practice (4-6 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:

1. **Comfort with water on face** - Start with the child standing or sitting at the water's edge. Gently splash water toward their face and talk about how water feels: "The water is cool and wet! That's okay!" Gradually introduce splashing their own face. Do NOT force water into eyes, nose, or mouth.

2. **Supported entry into water** - Hold the child securely with both hands at chest level. Help them slowly step into the water. Say: "Nice and slow. I've got you. You're safe!" Let them feel the water around their legs and body.

3. **Floating support and awareness** - With your hands supporting the child under their arms and torso, gently move them through the water. Explain the science: "The water is pushing up on you right now — that force is called buoyancy. When you take a deep breath and hold it, your lungs fill with air and you become less dense than the water, so you float better. Try taking a big breath... feel how the water holds you more?" Keep movements slow and calm. Let the child experiment with a deep breath vs. exhaled position to feel the difference.

**Coaching cues**:
- "Keep your body relaxed in the water"
- "Look at me - I'm right here with you"
- "You're doing great! Water is our friend when we're careful"
- "Breathe slowly - in and out"

#### Guided Play/Game (3-5 minutes)

**Game structure**: "Safety Water Friends"

Turn water safety practice into a game by introducing the idea of water safety helpers and rescue.

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. An adult is always holding or touching the child in water
2. We move slowly and carefully
3. When I say "Safety Friend," you stop and hold my hand

**Variations**:
- **Floating Friends**: Introduce a small flotation toy and demonstrate how it helps stay safe: "This ring helps keep us safe - let's hold it together!"
- **Rescue Practice**: Using a toy or stuffed animal, demonstrate simple "rescue" by picking it up from shallow water. Let the child help: "We're rescuing our friend! Is it safe? Yes, the water is shallow!"
- **Water Song Safety**: Sing a simple safety song while gently moving in the water: "We're in the water, safe and sound, adult is here, right all around!" (to tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle")

**Turn-taking** (if applicable):
- If multiple children are present, take turns with direct supervision (one child in water at a time with dedicated adult)
- Use a "water timer" (egg timer or simple count) to ensure each child gets equal time
- While waiting, the other child watches from the dry zone and can practice safety skills on land (sitting, standing, stretching)

#### Free Exploration (2-3 minutes)

Let the child play safely in the shallow water with gentle adult supervision.
- What to encourage: "Splash gently! Feel the water! You're doing great!"
- When to observe: Watch for signs of tiredness, shivering, or anxiety - stop if any appear
- Celebrate attempts: "You're learning to be water smart!"

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Transition from active water time to calm ending, ensure proper drying, and reflect on water safety learning.

**Cool-down activities**:
1. Gentle exit from water - Help child step out slowly while sitting on the edge first, then standing. Wrap immediately in a towel. Say: "Great job exiting the water slowly!"
2. Towel fun - Make drying playful: "Can you wrap up like a burrito?" while patting dry
3. Calm sitting time - Sit together in a dry area with a warm towel. Review what we learned: "We learned how to be safe in the water! We stay with our adult. The water was fun!"

**Transition**:
- Change into dry clothes
- Offer warm (not hot) water or juice
- Sit together for a few minutes before returning to other activities

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Much shorter water sessions (10-12 minutes maximum)
- Shallower water (6-9 inches maximum)
- Never force water on the face or introduce breath-holding
- Focus on comfort and positive association, NOT skill achievement
- Constant physical contact and support - no independent movement
- One adult dedicated to one child (1:1 ratio)
- Use simple words: "water," "safe," "adult," "float"
- Many breaks for reassurance and checking comfort level

**Duration**: 10-12 minutes of actual water time plus setup/warm-up

**Adult support**:
- Hands-on support at all times (child in contact with adult)
- Verbal reassurance throughout
- One adult fully focused on water safety
- Second adult watching from dry area (if possible)

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Gradually introduce water on face (child initiated, not forced)
- Practice simple breath control: "Blow bubbles" while at water's edge
- Introduce floating with less hand support (guide by hips instead of full support)
- Simple "rescue" role-play with toys
- Teach water safety rules verbally and reinforce
- Can tolerate slightly deeper water (up to waist height when standing)
- Can follow more complex instructions: "Walk to the edge, hold my hand, sit down slowly"

**Duration**: Can extend to 15-20 minutes

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**:
  - "You're being so brave and water smart!"
  - "I'm right here with you - you're safe"
  - "The water is nice and cool - how does it feel?"
  - "You're learning to be a water friend!"

- **What to avoid**:
  - Never force a child into water or force water on their face
  - Don't use scary language about water ("water can get you," "don't drown")
  - Don't compare children's comfort levels
  - Don't leave them unattended, even for a moment
  - Don't rush - water comfort takes time to build

- **When to help**:
  - Help immediately if child shows fear or anxiety
  - Provide support during entry and exit at all times
  - Assist during floating activities
  - Help if child loses balance or confidence
  - Stop the session if child is shivering, tired, or upset

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child is afraid of water or refuses to enter

**Why**: Water is a novel sensory experience - splashing, temperature change, wetness are all new. Some children need more time to acclimate. Fear of water is developmentally normal and NOT a failure.

**Solution**:
- Don't force entry - let child observe first
- Start with very shallow water (2-3 inches)
- Use a sponge or washcloth to introduce water gradually
- Let child play at the edge first (splashing without full body immersion)
- Practice in familiar space (bathtub) before pool
- Introduce water through play (pouring cups, splashing toys)

**Timeline**: Most children warm up to water by 3rd-5th session if not pressured. Some take weeks or months. This is normal.

---

**Challenge**: Child coughs, sputters, or gets water in their nose/mouth

**Why**: Young children are still developing the ability to coordinate breathing and mouth closing around water. They have not yet learned breath-hold control. This is completely normal and happens to all young children learning water skills.

**Solution**:
- Stop immediately and calm the child
- Have them sit out of water and catch breath
- Reassure: "You're okay, the water surprised you. That's normal."
- Do NOT punish or show alarm
- Gently dry their face
- If they want to continue, wait a few minutes and try again with less water on face
- Focus only on comfort, not skill, at this age

**Timeline**: Breath control improves naturally around age 4+ with repeated, gentle exposure. Never force or drill it.

---

**Challenge**: Child won't stay in the water - keeps asking to get out

**Why**: Water sensory input may be overwhelming, or they may be cold, tired, or simply prefer land-based play. This is developmentally appropriate - forcing them to stay teaches fear, not safety.

**Solution**:
- Honor the child's request to exit
- Never force them to stay in water
- Praise their effort: "You tried the water - that was brave!"
- Try again another day
- Some children do better with very brief sessions (2-3 minutes)
- Gradually extend time if they show willingness
- Use play to build positive association (water songs, splashing games on land)

**Timeline**: Some children develop water comfort naturally over months, others take a year or more. This variation is normal and not concerning if always paired with positive experiences.

### Safety Reminders

- **Constant supervision**: An adult must have eyes and hands on the child at all times. Drowning is often silent — a person whose airway is compromised cannot shout because the body's involuntary reflex closes the throat to block water. Do NOT rely on hearing a cry for help; watch continuously.
- **Never leave unattended**: Not even to grab a towel or phone. Bring everything needed to the water area first.
- **Watch for signs of cold**: Shivering, lips turning blue, chattering teeth, or lethargy mean it's time to exit and warm up
- **Appropriate water depth**: For ages 2-3, water should never exceed waist height, and shallower is better (6-9 inches ideal)
- **Non-slip surfaces**: Wet surfaces are extremely slippery. Use mats and move slowly
- **No pressure**: If the child is uncomfortable, stop. There's no failure in this activity - only comfort-building
- **CPR and first aid knowledge**: Caregivers should be trained in infant/child CPR before working with children around water

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Decreased anxiety about water on lower body (legs, torso)
- Willing entry into water with support (sitting or being guided)
- Relaxed posture in supported floating position
- Decreased fear responses to water sensations
- Increased verbalization about water ("water is cold," "water is fun")
- Able to sit at water edge without fear of falling in
- Can participate in simple water-based games
- Shows confidence being partially submerged with adult support

**Progression over weeks/months**:
- **Weeks 1-2**: Focus on comfort and observation. Child may not enter water - this is fine
- **Weeks 3-4**: Child tolerates water on lower body, accepts light splashing
- **Weeks 5-8**: Child can sit in very shallow water with support, shows decreased fear
- **Months 2-3**: Child participates in simple water activities, can move slightly while supported
- **Months 3-6**: Child demonstrates comfort with floating support, understands basic safety rules
- **6+ months**: Depending on exposure frequency, child may begin to show readiness for actual swim instruction

**When to add challenge**:
- Only after child consistently shows comfort and confidence with current level
- Never rush to the next skill - water safety is built on comfort, not speed
- Wait for child-initiated interest in new skills (e.g., "I want to try floating by myself!")
- Ensure adult is confident and trained for any new activity level
- Consider formal swim lessons after age 3.5 if child shows sustained interest and comfort

*For children ages 2-4+ years. Adapt to your child's physical abilities and comfort level. Water safety and rescue practice is designed to build confidence and establish safety habits, not to teach swimming. Drowning prevention requires constant adult supervision and water safety knowledge. Consider formal water safety certification for caregivers working with young children around water.*
