# PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Yoga Poses and Sequences

## Activity Summary

Yoga poses and sequences introduce young children to mindful movement, body awareness, and emotional regulation through playful, animal-inspired postures. This activity builds flexibility, balance, core strength, and coordination while teaching children how to calm their minds and connect with their bodies. Yoga is an excellent foundation for lifelong wellness, helping children develop self-awareness, confidence, and healthy stress management tools from an early age.

**Activity Type**: Mind-body practice

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes (with natural breaks)

**Energy Level**: Low to Moderate

**Best Environment**: Indoor gymnasium, living room, or quiet outdoor space

**Space Required**: 6x6 feet minimum per child (yoga mat-sized space)

## Complete Activity Structure

### Equipment Needed

**Essential items**:
- Yoga mats or towels - soft surface for floor work (one per child, or can share)
- Comfortable, loose-fitting clothing - allows full range of motion
- Bare feet or soft socks - for better balance and floor contact

**Optional enhancements**:
- Yoga blocks or cushions - supports balance and alignment in poses
- Soft music or nature sounds - creates calming atmosphere (instrumental, 60-80 BPM)
- Props (scarves, ribbons) - adds playful element to flow
- Bells or chimes - signals transitions between poses
- Mirror - helps children see their body positioning

**DIY alternatives**:
- Regular blankets or bath towels instead of yoga mats
- Household pillows instead of yoga blocks
- Phone with free music app (Spotify, YouTube) instead of purchased music
- Natural sounds (birds outside, wind) instead of recorded music

**Cost estimate**: Free (household items) to under $30 (if purchasing mats and blocks)

**Safety equipment**: Non-slip yoga mat or towel to prevent sliding

### Space Setup

**Before starting**:
1. Clear the area of obstacles, toys, and furniture that could interfere with movement
2. Ensure flooring is clean and non-slip (place mats away from sharp corners)
3. Remove shoes and socks if using mats for traction; keep socks on if floors are cold
4. Have water nearby but out of reach during practice
5. Ensure room temperature is comfortable (not too cold)
6. Dim lights or close bright curtains if possible to create calm environment

**Boundaries**: Use the edges of yoga mats or arrange mats in a circle to define each child's personal practice space

**Safety considerations**:
- Never force children into stretches - yoga should always be pain-free and comfortable
- Watch for overstretching, especially with younger toddlers who have developing flexibility
- Keep practice away from water sources, stairs, and hard furniture edges
- Stop immediately if child reports pain (distinguish from normal stretch sensation)
- Ensure adequate space between children to prevent collisions during transitions
- Check room temperature - children lose body heat quickly when still
- Avoid practice immediately after large meals

## Session Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Prepare the body for movement, increase circulation, and transition children from active play into mindful practice

**Warm-up activities**:
1. **Gentle neck rolls** - Slowly roll head in circles, 2-3 times each direction. Say: "Let's wake up our neck like a turtle looking around."
2. **Shoulder shrugs and rolls** - Lift shoulders to ears, hold for a breath, release. Roll backward 2-3 times. Say: "Shrug your shoulders up to your ears, then let them fall down, down, down."
3. **Easy side stretches** - Reach one arm overhead and gently lean to the side. Switch sides. Say: "Reach up tall like a growing tree, then gently lean to feel a nice stretch."

**Warm-up cues**: Keep language playful and encouraging. Use animal references and nature imagery to make movements fun.

### Main Activity (8-12 minutes)

#### Introduction & Demonstration (1-2 minutes)
- Introduce the concept of yoga as a way to help our bodies feel strong and our minds feel calm
- Show how we'll become different animals and objects through poses
- Demonstrate one simple pose (like Mountain Pose) so children know what to expect
- Key coaching point: "In yoga, we listen to our bodies and never push too hard. It should feel good!"

#### Skill Practice (3-5 minutes)

**Skill breakdown**:

**Movement Component 1: Foundation Poses (Standing base)**
- Mountain Pose (Tadasana) - Stand tall with feet together or hip-width apart, arms at sides, weight balanced
- Tree Pose (Vrksasana) - Stand on one leg, place other foot on inner thigh or calf, hands in prayer at chest
- Warrior Pose (Virabhadrasana I) - Step one foot back, bend front knee, arms reaching forward or overhead

**Movement Component 2: Animal-Inspired Poses (Engaging imagination)**
- Cat Pose (Marjaryasana) - On hands and knees, arch back and look up: "Meow! See the cat stretch."
- Cow Pose (Bitilasana) - On hands and knees, drop belly, look slightly up: "Moo! The cow is happy."
- Dog Pose (Adho Mukha Svanasana) - Inverted V-shape, hands and feet on ground, head between arms
- Butterfly Pose (Bhadasana) - Sit with soles of feet together, gently flap knees like butterfly wings

**Movement Component 3: Putting it together - Simple sequences**
- Warm-up flowing into 3-4 poses, holding each for 3-5 breaths
- Use transition language: "When I say 'breathe in,' we'll move to the next pose"

**Coaching cues**:
- "Stand tall like a mountain, strong and still"
- "Reach your arms like tree branches swaying in the breeze"
- "Make your back round like a stretching cat, then drop your belly like a happy cow"
- "You're doing such a great job listening to your body!"

#### Guided Play/Game (3-5 minutes)

**Game structure**: "Animal Yoga Journey" - Lead children through a story-based sequence visiting different animals

**Rules** (keep very simple):
1. When I say an animal name, become that animal in a pose
2. Hold the pose and breathe while I count to 5
3. When I say "transition," we move to the next animal
4. Everyone moves at their own pace - there's no right or wrong way

**Variations**:
- **Animal choices**: Let children call out which animal to become next, then guide them into the pose
- **Freeze dance yoga**: Play music and have children move freely, when music stops they freeze in a yoga pose
- **Partner poses**: For older children, simple partner poses like back-to-back Mountain Pose or mirroring poses
- **Imagination extension**: "We're on a safari! Can you be a tall giraffe reaching for leaves?" (Stretch arms high)

**Turn-taking** (if applicable): If doing partner poses, rotate partners after 2-3 poses so everyone gets a turn with different friends

#### Free Exploration (1-2 minutes)

Let children experiment with their own animal poses or favorite poses from the sequence
- Encourage creativity: "Can you make up your own animal pose?"
- Observe without correcting - celebrate all attempts
- Note which poses children naturally return to (often their favorite or easiest)

### Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Transition from activity to calm, help children regulate their nervous system, prepare for rest or next activity

**Cool-down activities**:
1. **Slow Child's Pose (Balasana)** - Kneel on mat, fold forward with arms extended or alongside body, forehead resting. Say: "Let's rest like little seeds tucked into the ground."
2. **Seated forward fold** - Sit with legs extended, gently fold forward as far as comfortable. Say: "We're like flowers closing up for the night."
3. **Lying down relaxation (Savasana)** - Lie on back, legs extended, arms at sides with palms up. Close eyes. Say: "Let's rest our bodies. Think about what we loved most about our yoga practice today."

**Transition**: Use a gentle voice and slower movements. Optional: Play soft music or ring a soft bell to signal relaxation time.

## Age Adaptations

### 2-3 years

**Modifications**:
- Use only 3-4 simple poses (focus on Cat, Cow, Dog, and Mountain)
- Hold poses for only 2-3 breaths (even 1 breath is success for youngest)
- Make all poses hands-on if needed - help position their body gently
- Shorten entire session to 8-10 minutes
- Use simple, concrete language: "Hands and knees," "Stretch," "Stand tall"
- Expect lots of wiggling and distraction - this is normal
- Have mats very close together so you can easily assist each child

**Adult support**: High level of hands-on guidance. Gently position their limbs, help them understand where their body should be. Use lots of encouragement and celebrate any attempt.

**Duration**: 8-10 minutes total (shorter, more frequent practice is better than long sessions)

### 3-4+ years

**Challenges to add**:
- Introduce 6-8 poses in sequence, building a "yoga story"
- Hold poses for 5-8 breaths, teaching breath awareness
- Add balance challenges (Tree Pose with eyes closed, standing on one leg)
- Introduce simple breath awareness: "Breathe in through your nose for a count of 3, out through your mouth for a count of 3"
- Create longer sequences (6-10 poses in a flowing order)
- Encourage children to help demonstrate and teach poses to peers
- Add partner poses with guided practice
- Introduce simple yoga principles: "Yoga helps us feel calm," "Yoga gives us strong bodies"

**Duration**: 12-15 minutes (children this age can sustain focus longer)

## Parent/Caregiver Notes

### Encouragement & Coaching Tips

- **What to say**: "I love how you're listening to your body and doing your best." "That stretch feels so good, doesn't it?" "You're creating a strong, flexible body." "Take your time - there's no race in yoga."
- **What to avoid**: Correcting form too strictly ("That's wrong"), comparing children ("Look how high she can stretch"), rushing through poses ("Hurry up"), or saying "Be still" when child is moving naturally
- **When to help**: Offer assistance when a child asks, when they look confused about positioning, or when they might be at risk of losing balance. Allow them to attempt independently first.

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Child won't sit still or keep moving through poses
**Why**: 2-3-year-olds have developing attention spans (5-10 minutes max) and need frequent movement breaks. Yoga is new and unfamiliar.
**Solution**: Shorten session to 8 minutes, switch between standing and floor poses frequently, use more playful language and storytelling, don't expect stillness during relaxation yet
**Timeline**: By age 4, attention span improves. With regular practice (3-4 times weekly), children learn what to expect and settle faster.

**Challenge**: Child complains poses hurt or refuses to try stretches
**Why**: Muscle soreness from unfamiliar activity, fear of unknown positions, or legitimate flexibility limitations
**Solution**: Never force stretches - yoga should feel good. Offer modifications (bend knees more, reduce range), let child hold an easier version, validate their feeling ("Your body is telling us to be gentle"), use gentler music and language
**Timeline**: Within 2-3 weeks of regular practice, muscles adjust and comfort improves

**Challenge**: Child compares themselves to others ("I can't do that pose!")
**Why**: Early social comparison and perfectionism beginning to emerge; fear of looking different
**Solution**: Emphasize "Everyone's body is different and special," "Yoga is not about how it looks," "Your body is perfect as it is," celebrate effort over achievement, offer modifications that feel easier
**Timeline**: Continues through early childhood; consistent positive messaging helps build body confidence

**Challenge**: Difficulty focusing or getting distracted by toys/siblings during practice
**Why**: Young children have fragmented attention; visual distractions compete for focus
**Solution**: Practice in a quiet room with minimal visual clutter, practice at a consistent time, use fewer but more engaging cues, make it shorter and more active, practice near where child usually plays
**Timeline**: Improves significantly between ages 3-4 with routine practice

### Safety Reminders

- Never force a child into a deeper stretch - yoga should always be comfortable and pain-free
- Watch for overstretching in flexible children - congratulate their flexibility while teaching restraint ("Your body is very bendy! We don't want to hurt anything, so let's not stretch SO deep")
- Ensure adequate space between children to prevent accidental collisions
- Stop practice if child reports sharp pain (distinguish from normal muscle stretch feeling)
- Keep practice away from hard furniture edges, stairs, and water sources
- Check room temperature - children lose body heat when stationary; keep space warm enough
- Avoid practice immediately after meals (wait at least 30-45 minutes)
- Stay hydrated but have water nearby rather than during poses

### Progress Tracking

**Signs of skill development**:
- Improved balance in standing poses (can hold Tree Pose for longer)
- Increased flexibility (able to fold forward further)
- Better body awareness (understands which poses are challenging vs. easy for their body)
- Longer attention span during practice (progresses from 8 to 15 minutes)
- Ability to name poses and animal movements
- Calmer behavior after practice (especially noticeable in transition to rest time)
- Voluntary participation (asks "Can we do yoga?")
- Ability to follow 2-3 step instructions in sequence

**When to add challenge**:
- When child can hold basic poses steadily for 5+ breaths
- When they show interest in learning new poses without being prompted
- When they can follow a 6-8 pose sequence without redirection
- When they're not frustrated by their abilities but proud of them
- When asking "What's next?" or showing eagerness for longer practice
