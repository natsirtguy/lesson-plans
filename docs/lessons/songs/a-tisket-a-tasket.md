# SONG: A Tisket A Tasket

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
A tisket, a tasket, a green and yellow basket
I wrote a letter to my love and on the way I lost it
I lost it, I lost it, and on the way I lost it
A little girl picked it up and put it in her pocket

**Verse 2:**
A tisket, a tasket, a green and yellow basket
She took my letter from the ground and never did she ask it
She asked me, she asked me, how could she have asked me?
A tisket, a tasket, a green and yellow basket
