- **BANANA** - Hold your non-dominant hand upright with fingers extended. With your dominant hand, pretend to peel the "banana" by moving your fingers downward along the outside of your other hand, mimicking a peeling motion.

- **EAT** - Bring all fingers of your dominant hand together in a pinched position and bring them to your mouth, as if putting food in your mouth. Repeat this motion 2-3 times.

- **LIKE** - Place your dominant hand over your heart with fingers extended and slightly spread. Pull your hand away from your body while closing your fingers into a fist, as if pulling likable feelings from your heart.

- **FRUIT** - Form an F-shape with your right hand (thumb and index finger forming a circle). Tap this F-shape against your cheek once or twice.

- **MANY** - Form both hands into O-shapes by joining your thumb and fingers. Hold them at chest level and open both hands wide while moving them outward, as if showing plenty.
