# SONG: Clementine

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
In a cavern, in a canyon, excavating for a mine
Lived a miner, forty-niner, and his daughter Clementine
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine

**Verse 2:**
Light she was and like a fairy, and her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes without topses, sandals were for Clementine
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine

**Verse 3:**
Drove she ducklings to the water, every morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter, fell into the foaming brine
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine

**Verse 4:**
How I missed her, how I missed her, how I missed my Clementine
But I kissed her little sister, and forgot my Clementine
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine
You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine
