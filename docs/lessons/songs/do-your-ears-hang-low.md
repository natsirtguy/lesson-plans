# SONG: Do Your Ears Hang Low

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Do your ears hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?
Can you tie them in a knot?
Can you tie them in a bow?
Can you throw them o'er your shoulder
Like a Continental soldier?
Do your ears hang low?

**Verse 2 (Optional - silly variation):**
Do your ears stick out?
Do they wave about?
Can you use them as a sail?
Or can you use them as a tail?
Can you tie them in a knot?
Can you tie them in a bow?
Do your ears stick out?
