# SONG: Down by the Bay

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Down by the bay, where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home, I dare not go,
For if I do, my mother will say,
"Did you ever see a bear combing his hair?"
Down by the bay!

**Verse 2:**
Down by the bay, where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home, I dare not go,
For if I do, my mother will say,
"Did you ever see a moose kissing a goose?"
Down by the bay!

**Verse 3:**
Down by the bay, where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home, I dare not go,
For if I do, my mother will say,
"Did you ever see a whale with a polka dot tail?"
Down by the bay!

**Verse 4:**
Down by the bay, where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home, I dare not go,
For if I do, my mother will say,
"Did you ever see a llama eating a banana?"
Down by the bay!

- **BEAR** - Cross both arms across your chest and claw your fingers downward on both sides of your chest in a scratching motion. This represents the large build and powerful claws of a bear.

- **MOOSE** - Hold both hands up beside your head with fingers spread wide like large branching antlers. You can wiggle your fingers to emphasize the impressive antlers that moose are known for.

- **GOOSE** - Hold your hand in front of your mouth with fingers pinched together, then wiggle them while moving your hand forward and downward, imitating a goose's honking call and long neck.

- **WATERMELON** - Make an oval shape with both hands in front of you, then use both index fingers to tap spots on your pretend watermelon to show the seeds and green color of the fruit.
