# SONG: Five Little Ducks

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Five little ducks went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck called "Quack, quack, quack, quack"
And four little ducks came back

**Verse 2:**
Four little ducks went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck called "Quack, quack, quack, quack"
And three little ducks came back

**Verse 3:**
Three little ducks went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck called "Quack, quack, quack, quack"
And two little ducks came back

**Verse 4:**
Two little ducks went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck called "Quack, quack, quack, quack"
And one little duck came back

**Verse 5:**
One little duck went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck called "Quack, quack, quack, quack"
And no little ducks came back

**Final Verse:**
Mother duck went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck called "Quack, quack, quack, quack"
And all five little ducks came back
