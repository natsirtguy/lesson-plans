# SONG: Five Little Monkeys

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Five little monkeys jumping on the bed,
One fell off and bumped his head,
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"

**Verse 2:**
Four little monkeys jumping on the bed,
One fell off and bumped his head,
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"

**Verse 3:**
Three little monkeys jumping on the bed,
One fell off and bumped his head,
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"

**Verse 4:**
Two little monkeys jumping on the bed,
One fell off and bumped his head,
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"

**Verse 5:**
One little monkey jumping on the bed,
He fell off and bumped his head,
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"Put those monkeys back in bed!"

## Song Overview

"Five Little Monkeys" is an engaging countdown song that combines silly humor, repetitive structure, and action-based learning to captivate young children. This song naturally teaches subtraction and number sequencing through a story children find hilarious—the repeated "bumped his head" and the doctor's warnings provide predictable, laughable moments that keep toddlers entertained through all five verses. The song supports counting skills, memory development (as verses follow the same pattern), and language learning through rhythmic repetition, while the bouncing and falling actions provide excellent gross motor practice.
