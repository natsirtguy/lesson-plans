# SONG: Five Little Pumpkins

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Five little pumpkins sitting on a gate,
The first one said, "Oh my, it's getting late!"
The second one said, "There are witches in the air!"
The third one said, "But we don't care!"

**Verse 2:**
The fourth one said, "Let's run and run and run!"
The fifth one said, "Let's have some fun!"
Whooooo went the wind, and out went the light,
And the five little pumpkins rolled out of sight.

## Song Overview

Five Little Pumpkins is a delightful seasonal nursery rhyme that introduces young children to fall traditions, counting, and storytelling through a whimsical adventure featuring character pumpkins with distinct personalities. The song combines counting practice (one through five) with character voices and emotions, helping 2-4 year olds develop language skills, emotional awareness, and the ability to follow a narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and exciting ending. The dramatic moment when the wind blows the pumpkins away ("Whooooo went the wind, and out went the light") provides just enough excitement to hold children's attention while remaining age-appropriate, and the predictable structure makes it easy for children to join in and anticipate what comes next.

While the exact author is unknown, this rhyme emerged from the American tradition of incorporating seasonal themes into early childhood education.

## Cultural Notes

Five Little Pumpkins is deeply associated with American fall and Halloween traditions, though versions of pumpkin-themed songs exist in other cultures with their own seasonal vegetables or fruits. The song is particularly popular in the United States and Canada during the autumn season, from September through November, and is commonly featured in preschool and elementary school classrooms during fall celebrations. While the song references witches (a playful Halloween element), it keeps the mood lighthearted and fun rather than scary, making it age-appropriate for toddlers and preschoolers. Caregivers can use this song to help children learn about pumpkins, harvests, and seasonal changes, and it provides a wonderful opportunity to discuss how different cultures celebrate the transition to autumn in their own ways.
