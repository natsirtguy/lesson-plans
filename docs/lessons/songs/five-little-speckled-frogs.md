# SONG: Five Little Speckled Frogs

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Five little speckled frogs
Sat on a speckled log,
Eating some most delicious bugs,
Yum, yum!

One jumped into the pool,
Where it was nice and cool,
Now there are four little speckled frogs,
Glub, glub!

**Verse 2:**
Four little speckled frogs
Sat on a speckled log,
Eating some most delicious bugs,
Yum, yum!

One jumped into the pool,
Where it was nice and cool,
Now there are three little speckled frogs,
Glub, glub!

**Verse 3:**
Three little speckled frogs
Sat on a speckled log,
Eating some most delicious bugs,
Yum, yum!

One jumped into the pool,
Where it was nice and cool,
Now there are two little speckled frogs,
Glub, glub!

**Verse 4:**
Two little speckled frogs
Sat on a speckled log,
Eating some most delicious bugs,
Yum, yum!

One jumped into the pool,
Where it was nice and cool,
Now there is one little speckled frog,
Glub, glub!

**Verse 5:**
One little speckled frog
Sat on a speckled log,
Eating some most delicious bugs,
Yum, yum!

One jumped into the pool,
Where it was nice and cool,
Now there are no little speckled frogs,
Glub, glub!

## ASL Signs

Learn these signs to use while singing:

- **FROG** - Make a "V" shape with your index and middle fingers and press them under your chin, then move your hand forward in a hopping motion. You can also make a ribbit sound to enhance the sign with the animal sound.

- **JUMP** - Hold both hands with fingers curled, facing down, in front of your body. Quickly bounce your hands up and down in rhythm to show the jumping motion of a frog leaping into the water.

- **LITTLE** - Hold your non-dominant hand flat, palm down, and pinch your thumb and index finger of your dominant hand above it to show a small space between them. This represents something being very small or tiny.

- **LOG** - Make both hands into "C" shapes with palms facing each other, side by side, to represent the long, cylindrical shape of a wooden log. Move them forward slightly to show the log sitting in the water.

- **WATER** - Hold all four fingers of your right hand together and tap them on your chin (the initial W sign), then move your hand downward. This represents water flowing down or the element of water.

- **POOL** - Make both hands into "P" shapes and bring them together to form a circle in front of you, moving them down and around to show the shape and depth of a pool of water.

- **FIVE** - Hold up all five fingers on one hand spread wide apart to show the number five. This helps children count along with the song as the number decreases with each verse.
