# SONG: Georgie Porgie

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Georgie Porgie, pudding and pie,
Kissed the girls and made them cry,
When the boys came out to play,
Georgie Porgie ran away.

**Verse 2:**
Georgie Porgie came again,
He kissed them all, again and again,
When the girls came out to play,
Georgie Porgie ran away.
