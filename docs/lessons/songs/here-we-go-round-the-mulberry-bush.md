# SONG: Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Here we go round the mulberry bush,
The mulberry bush, the mulberry bush,
Here we go round the mulberry bush,
So early in the morning.

**Verse 2:**
This is the way we wash our hands,
Wash our hands, wash our hands,
This is the way we wash our hands,
So early in the morning.

**Verse 3:**
This is the way we brush our teeth,
Brush our teeth, brush our teeth,
This is the way we brush our teeth,
So early in the morning.

**Verse 4:**
This is the way we comb our hair,
Comb our hair, comb our hair,
This is the way we comb our hair,
So early in the morning.

**Verse 5:**
This is the way we put on our clothes,
Put on our clothes, put on our clothes,
This is the way we put on our clothes,
So early in the morning.

**Verse 6:**
This is the way we wash our face,
Wash our face, wash our face,
This is the way we wash our face,
So early in the morning.
