# SONG: I'm a Little Teapot

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
I'm a little teapot
Short and stout
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
When I get all steamed up
Hear me shout
Tip me over
Pour me out

**Verse 2:**
I'm a clever teapot
Yes it's true
Here let me show what I can do
I can change my handle and my spout
Just tip me over and pour me out
