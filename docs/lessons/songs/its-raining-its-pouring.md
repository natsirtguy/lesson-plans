# SONG: It's Raining It's Pouring

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
It's raining, it's pouring
The old man is snoring
He bumped his head and went to bed
And couldn't get up in the morning

**Verse 2 (Alternative/Extended):**
Rain, rain, go away
Come again some other day
All the world is fresh and green
Prettiest sight I've ever seen
