# SONG: Jack and Jill

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown,
And Jill came tumbling after.

**Verse 2:**
Up Jack got and home did trot
As fast as he could caper,
To old Dame Dob who patched his nob
With vinegar and brown paper.
