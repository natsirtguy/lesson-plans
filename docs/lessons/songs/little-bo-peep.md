# SONG: Little Bo Peep

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep,
And can't tell where to find them;
Leave them alone, and they'll come home,
Bringing their tails behind them.

**Verse 2:**
Little Bo Peep fell fast asleep,
And dreamt she heard them bleating;
But when she woke, she found a joke,
That they were still a-fleeting.

**Verse 3:**
Then up she took her little crook,
Determined for to find them;
She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
For they'd left all their tails behind them.
