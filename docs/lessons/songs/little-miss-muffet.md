# SONG: Little Miss Muffet

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Little Miss Muffet
Sat on a tuffet
Eating her curds and whey
Along came a spider
Who sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away

**Verse 2:**
She ran from that spider
She ran fast and wider
And didn't look back one day
But soon she grew braver
This small little raver
And went back to sit and play

**Verse 3:**
Now Miss Muffet's wiser
The spider's befriended her
They sit on that tuffet today
She eats her curds and whey so sweet
While spiders eat bugs as their treat
A friendship that's here to stay
