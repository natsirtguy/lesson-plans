# SONG: Mary Had a Little Lamb

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Mary had a little lamb,
Little lamb, little lamb,
Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow.

**Verse 2:**
And everywhere that Mary went,
Mary went, Mary went,
Everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go.

**Verse 3:**
It followed her to school one day,
School one day, school one day,
It followed her to school one day,
Which was against the rule.

**Verse 4:**
It made the children laugh and play,
Laugh and play, laugh and play,
It made the children laugh and play,
To see a lamb at school.
