# SONG: On Top of Spaghetti

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
On top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese,
I lost my poor meatball when somebody sneezed.
It rolled off the table and onto the floor,
And then my poor meatball rolled out of the door.

**Verse 2:**
It rolled in the garden and under a bush,
And then my poor meatball was nothing but mush.
The mush was as tasty as tasty could be,
And then the next summer it grew into a tree.

**Verse 3:**
The tree was all covered with beautiful moss,
It grew lovely meatballs and tomato sauce.
So if you eat spaghetti all covered with cheese,
Hold on to your meatball and don't ever sneeze!

- **Rolled** - Make a rolling motion with both hands by rotating them over and over each other, moving forward across your body as if something is rolling away.
- **Tree** - Point one arm upward with hand open and fingers spread wide like branches, then move other arm up alongside to show the trunk growing tall.
- **Cheese** - Press the heel of one hand into the palm of the other hand, then move hands apart as if pulling apart a stretched piece of cheese.
- **Garden** - Make flat hand shapes with palms down. Move hands outward to the sides and slightly forward, as if showing a wide, flat garden space.
