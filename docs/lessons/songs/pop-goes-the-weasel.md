# SONG: Pop Goes the Weasel

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
All around the mulberry bush
The monkey chased the weasel
The monkey thought 'twas all in fun
Pop! goes the weasel

**Verse 2:**
A penny for a spool of thread
A penny for a needle
That's the way the money goes
Pop! goes the weasel

**Verse 3:**
Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Mix it all up nice and tight
Pop! goes the weasel
