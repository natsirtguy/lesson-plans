# SONG: Ring Around the Rosie

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Ring around the rosie,
A pocket full of posies,
Ashes, ashes,
We all fall down.

**Verse 2:**
The cows are in the meadow,
Eating buttercups,
Ashes, ashes,
We all fall down.

**Origin**: "Ring Around the Rosie" emerged in Europe, with the earliest printed version appearing in the 1880s. While the rhyme is often associated with the Great Plague of London (1666), this connection is historically disputed and likely a modern misconception created by later interpretations. The song's true origins may reference simple children's circle games or folk rhymes with similar structures that have been found across European cultures for centuries. It became particularly popular as a children's game in English-speaking countries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

## Cultural Notes

This song appears in numerous cultural variations around the world, each adapting the rhyme to local traditions and experiences. The British version "Ring a Ring o' Roses," the French "Ronde, Ronde," and the German "Ringelreihe" all follow similar patterns with their own unique verses and animals. Different cultures have created additional verses featuring local animals and seasonal activities such as ducks in ponds, children in fields, or specific cultural references. The disputed historical background of the rhyme adds to its mystique and cultural interest, though modern scholars increasingly suggest the song simply reflects a universal pattern of circle games rather than referencing specific historical events. The game's elegant simplicity and flexibility make it easily adaptable across different ages, settings, and cultural contexts, allowing each community to add its own creative variations.
