# SONG: Sing a Song of Sixpence

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Sing a song of sixpence,
A pocket full of rye,
Four and twenty blackbirds
Baked in a pie.

**Verse 2:**
When the pie was opened
The birds began to sing;
Wasn't that a dainty dish
To set before the King?

**Verse 3:**
The King was in his counting-house,
Counting out his money;
The Queen was in the parlour,
Eating bread and honey.

**Verse 4:**
The maid was in the garden,
Hanging out the clothes,
Along came a blackbird
And snipped off her nose.
