# SONG: Take Me Out to the Ball Game

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Take me out to the ball game,
Take me out to the crowd,
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,
I don't care if I never get back.
Let me root, root, root for the home team,
If they don't win, it's a shame.
For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out,
At the old ball game.

**Verse 2:**
Katie Casey was baseball mad,
Had the fever and had it bad,
Just to root for the home town crew,
Every sou that Katie blew.
On a Saturday her young beau,
Called to see if she'd like to go,
To see a show but Miss Katie said "No,
I'll tell you what you can do."

**Verse 3:**
Take me out to the ball game,
Take me out to the crowd,
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,
I don't care if I never get back.
Let me root, root, root for the home team,
If they don't win, it's a shame.
For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out,
At the old ball game.

**Origin**: Written in 1908 by Jack Norworth (lyrics) and Albert Von Tilzer (music), this iconic American song is one of the oldest and most recognizable tunes in American culture. Interestingly, neither composer had attended a baseball game when they wrote the song—yet they captured the spirit of American baseball culture perfectly! The song premiered in a Broadway musical and has since become the unofficial anthem of baseball, traditionally performed during the seventh-inning stretch at professional games for over a century. It remains one of the few songs from that era that children and adults worldwide still recognize and sing together.

**Duration**: About 2-3 minutes (depending on how many verses you sing and your tempo)
