So they all rolled over and one fell out
And he gave a little scream and a little shout
"Please remember to tie a knot in your pajamas"

"Roll over, roll over"
So they all rolled over and one fell out
And he gave a little scream and a little shout
"Please remember to tie a knot in your pajamas"

There were eight in the bed and the little one said
"Roll over, roll over"
So they all rolled over and one fell out
And he gave a little scream and a little shout
"Please remember to tie a knot in your pajamas"

There were seven in the bed and the little one said
"Roll over, roll over"
So they all rolled over and one fell out
And he gave a little scream and a little shout
"Please remember to tie a knot in your pajamas"

There were six in the bed and the little one said
"Roll over, roll over"
So they all rolled over and one fell out
And he gave a little scream and a little shout

There were five in the bed and the little one said
"Roll over, roll over"
So they all rolled over and one fell out

"Roll over, roll over"
So they all rolled over and one fell out
And he gave a little scream and a little shout

There were two in the bed and the little one said
"Roll over, roll over"
So they both rolled over and one fell out
And he gave a little scream and a little shout

There was one in the bed and the little one said
"Good night!"
