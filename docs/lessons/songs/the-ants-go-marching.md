**Verse 1:**
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah

The ants go marching one by one
The little one stops to suck his thumb
And they all go marching down
Into the ground
To get out of the rain

**Verse 2:**
The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah

The ants go marching two by two
The little one stops to tie his shoe
And they all go marching down
Into the ground
To get out of the rain

**Verse 3:**
The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three
The little one stops to climb a tree
And they all go marching down
Into the ground
To get out of the rain

**Verse 4:**
The ants go marching four by four, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching four by four, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching four by four
The little one stops to shut the door
And they all go marching down
Into the ground
To get out of the rain

**Verse 5:**
The ants go marching five by five, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching five by five, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching five by five
The little one stops to take a dive
And they all go marching down
Into the ground
To get out of the rain

**Verse 6:**
The ants go marching six by six, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching six by six, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching six by six
The little one stops to pick up sticks
And they all go marching down
Into the ground
To get out of the rain

**Verse 7:**
The ants go marching seven by seven, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching seven by seven, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching seven by seven
The little one stops to go to heaven
And they all go marching down
Into the ground
To get out of the rain

**Verse 8:**
The ants go marching eight by eight, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching eight by eight, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching eight by eight
The little one stops to don't be late
And they all go marching down
Into the ground
To get out of the rain

**Verse 9:**
The ants go marching nine by nine, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching nine by nine, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching nine by nine
The little one stops to check the time
And they all go marching down
Into the ground
To get out of the rain

**Verse 10:**
The ants go marching ten by ten, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching ten by ten, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching ten by ten
The little one stops and that's the end
And they all go marching down
Into the ground
To get out of the rain
