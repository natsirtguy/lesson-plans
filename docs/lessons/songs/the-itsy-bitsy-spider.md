# SONG: The Itsy Bitsy Spider

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again

**Verse 2:**
The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the window sill
Down came the rain and gave him quite a chill
Out came the sun all warm and dry
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed toward the sky

**Verse 3:**
The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the maple tree
Down came the rain so wet and cold, you see
Out came the sun, it shone so bright
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed on with all his might
