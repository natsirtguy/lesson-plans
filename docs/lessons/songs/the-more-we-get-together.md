# SONG: The More We Get Together

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
The more we get together, together, together
The more we get together, the happier we'll be
For your friends are my friends, and my friends are your friends
The more we get together, the happier we'll be

**Verse 2:**
The more we laugh together, together, together
The more we laugh together, the happier we'll be
For your joy is my joy, and my joy is your joy
The more we laugh together, the happier we'll be

**Verse 3:**
The more we play together, together, together
The more we play together, the happier we'll be
For your fun is my fun, and my fun is your fun
The more we play together, the happier we'll be
