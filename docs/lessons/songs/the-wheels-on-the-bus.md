# SONG: The Wheels on the Bus

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
The wheels on the bus go round and round,
Round and round, round and round,
The wheels on the bus go round and round,
All through the town.

**Verse 2:**
The doors on the bus go open and shut,
Open and shut, open and shut,
The doors on the bus go open and shut,
All through the town.

**Verse 3:**
The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep,
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep,
All through the town.

**Verse 4:**
The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish,
Swish, swish, swish, swish, swish, swish,
The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish,
All through the town.

**Verse 5:**
The people on the bus go up and down,
Up and down, up and down,
The people on the bus go up and down,
All through the town.

**Verse 6:**
The driver on the bus says, "Move on back!
Move on back, move on back!"
The driver on the bus says, "Move on back!"
All through the town.

**Verse 7:**
The babies on the bus go "Wah, wah, wah,"
"Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,"
The babies on the bus go "Wah, wah, wah,"
All through the town.

**Verse 8:**
The money in the box goes clink, clink, clink,
Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink,
The money in the box goes clink, clink, clink,
All through the town.
