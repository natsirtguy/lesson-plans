# SONG: There Was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.
She had so many children, she didn't know what to do;
She gave them some broth without any bread,
And whipped them all soundly and sent them to bed.

**Verse 2:**
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.
She had so many children, she didn't know what to do;
She gave them some broth and plenty of bread,
Then kissed them all kindly and sent them to bed.
