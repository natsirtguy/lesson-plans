# SONG: This Little Piggy

## Lyrics

**Verse 1 (for each toe, starting with the big toe):**
This little piggy went to market,
This little piggy stayed home,
This little piggy had roast beef,
This little piggy had none,
And this little piggy went wee wee wee all the way home!

*Note: Repeat the verse for each of the child's five toes, with the last line followed by a tickle on the final toe.*
