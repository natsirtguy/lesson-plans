# SONG: Three Blind Mice

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Three blind mice
See how they run
They all ran after the farmer's wife
Who cut off their tails with a carving knife
Did you ever see such a thing in your life
As three blind mice

**Verse 2:**
Three blind mice
See how they run
See how they run

**Verse 3:**
The farmer's wife was cutting bread
Three blind mice ran round her head
They scampered here and they scampered there
Three blind mice were everywhere
Did you ever see such a sight
As three blind mice
