# SONG: Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

## Song Overview

One of the most beloved lullabies in the English-speaking world, "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" has been sung to children for over 200 years. Its simple melody and gentle lyrics about wondering at the stars make it perfect for bedtime, quiet time, or introducing young children to music and singing.

**Category**: Lullabies

**Origin**: The lyrics were written by English poet Jane Taylor in 1806. The melody is from the French song "Ah! vous dirai-je, maman" (1761), which Mozart famously used for his piano variations.

**Duration**: About 1 minute to sing through once

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

**Verse 2:**
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

*(Traditional version has additional verses, but these two are most commonly sung with young children)*

## Hand Motions & Actions

1. **"Twinkle, twinkle"** - Open and close both hands like twinkling stars
2. **"Little star"** - Make a small star shape with fingers spread
3. **"How I wonder"** - Tap finger to chin in thinking pose
4. **"What you are"** - Shrug shoulders with palms up
5. **"Up above"** - Point up to the sky
6. **"World so high"** - Stretch arms up high
7. **"Like a diamond"** - Make diamond shape with thumbs and index fingers
8. **"In the sky"** - Sweep arms in arc overhead

## Teaching Tips

### For Ages 2-3:
- Start by just humming the melody while rocking or cuddling
- Sing slowly and clearly, emphasizing each word
- Use exaggerated hand motions - children love the twinkling hands
- Don't worry about getting all the words right at first
- Repeat, repeat, repeat - young children learn through repetition

### For Ages 3-4+:
- Encourage child to sing along with you
- Practice the hand motions together
- Talk about what stars are and when we see them
- Try singing it soft (lullaby style) and then louder (celebration style)
- Let child "teach" the song to a stuffed animal or doll

## Connection Activities

- **Stargazing**: Go outside at night and look for stars while singing
- **Art project**: Make star shapes with glitter or paint
- **Science talk**: Simple discussion about what stars are (big balls of fire far, far away)
- **Counting**: Count stars in a picture book or on pajamas
- **Rhythm**: Clap or tap along to the beat

## Why This Song Works

- **Simple melody**: Easy to remember and sing
- **Repetitive structure**: Helps with memory and prediction
- **Gentle tempo**: Calming for bedtime routines
- **Wonder and curiosity**: Encourages asking questions about the world
- **Physical engagement**: Hand motions keep little ones involved
