# SONG: Wee Willie Winkie

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town,
Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown,
Rapping at the window, crying at the lock,
"Are the children all in bed, for it's now eight o'clock?"

**Verse 2:**
Wee Willie Winkie is tired of play,
He'll ask you for something before he goes away,
He dines on blackberries and blackthorn jelly,
And supper of currants served up in a bowl.

**Verse 3:**
Wee Willie Winkie has come into town,
With stockings of silk and garters of brown,
He's rapped at the windows and cried at the locks,
Wake up, you lazy heads, it's past eight o'clock!

## Song Overview

Wee Willie Winkie is a charming Scottish nursery rhyme that personifies the character of bedtime itself, making sleep and nighttime routines feel like an adventure rather than a chore for young children. The rhythmic, bouncy cadence combined with the whimsical story of Willie checking on sleeping children helps 2-4 year olds anticipate and embrace bedtime with delight and imagination. The repetitive patterns and vivid descriptions (nightgown, tapping at windows, the clock striking eight) capture children's attention while subtly reinforcing healthy sleep habits and the importance of being ready for bed at a consistent time.
