# SONG: Yankee Doodle

## Lyrics

**Verse 1:**
Yankee Doodle came to town
Riding on a pony,
Stuck a feather in his cap
And called it macaroni.

**Chorus:**
Yankee Doodle, keep it up,
Yankee Doodle dandy,
Mind the music and the step,
And with the girls be handy.

**Verse 2:**
Father and I went down to camp
Along with Captain Gooding,
And there we saw the men and boys
As thick as hasty pudding.

**Verse 3:**
And there we saw a swamping gun,
Large as log of maple,
Upon a mighty little cart,
A load for father's table.

**Verse 4:**
Yankee Doodle went to town
For to buy a firelock,
We will tar and feather him,
And so we will shout "Yock!"
