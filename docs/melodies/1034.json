  "notes": "Traditional melody in C major for the first verse. The melody follows the classic pattern: E-D-C-D, E-E-E (rest), D-D-D (rest), E-G-G (rest), then repeats with variation. This is one of the most recognizable children's songs and is often used as a first melody for young music students. The same melody repeats for all verses of the song."
